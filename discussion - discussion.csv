Though this idea sparked many concerns for the public, the digital marketing realm found room for more opportunities. This is due to the fact that more and more brands are seeking out this new platform as an opportunity to connect with audiences in ways that were never possible before, such as providing exciting and memorable brand experiences. These opportunities are especially prominent, due to statics predicting that the metaverse will become an $800 billion market by 2024, these growing numbers not only reflect strong stability in this rising platform but also aid in providing a safeguard for those entering the metaverse. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Many concerns regarding the metaverse surface around confusion. Thus, in simple terms the metaverse is an online digital world that users can immerse themselves into, using virtual reality or augmented reality. Facebook has described the metaverse as being a set of virtual spaces where users can create and explore with other people who aren’t in the same physical space as each other. Users will be able to hang out with friends, work, play, learn, shop, create, and more. After grasping an understanding of what the metaverse is and how it can be an attractive social platform for people to join, one may question why marketers are so drawn to the metaverse? The answer is that marketers always strive to be up to date with the latest technological advancements. Marketing is in a continuous state of improvement and finding new ways to reach people. As mentioned in class, the customer journey has a number of different touchpoints that have to be made in order for a conversion to take place. Therefore, new marketing methods, such as creating virtual experiences, offering in-world purchases, and hosting virtual events are just a few ways marketing will be incorporated into the metaverse. These tactics will further aid in providing tailored touchpoints and enhancing overall consumer outreach. As the metaverse grows, marketers will begin to have more insights into the needs and wants of their audience. Though, it is also important to note that these methods heavily correlate with methods marketers already use today. After all, marketing is, at its core, a fight for attention, and the best way to keep people engaged is by providing new exciting content on different platforms! </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">If you want to learn more about how digital marketers are approaching the metaverse, the link to the article I read is attached below! </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Link: https://digitalagencynetwork.com/is-the-metaverse-the-future-of-digital-marketing/</p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,441,2351

I definitely agree! Though upon further analysis, I am now questioning the extent to which clients can market in the metaverse. Trends for the next year are predicting an increase and privacy protection laws and regulations, especially when it comes to obtaining cookies. Therefore, the tactics used in the metaverse may be more of a reflection of traditional marketing methods, such as avatars or friends in the metaverse using word-of-mouth techniques to buy products or services because they saw an influencer or promotional banner virtually, rather than these advertisements being truly tailored to the audience, the audience will now be offered an array of products and services that they can choose from willingly, not based upon prior data notice.

It's so incredible that you were able to gain hands-on experience with Google Analytics! I also agree that marketing, as well as many other fields, is evolving much faster than previously anticipated. As the world continues to grow and change, I believe that we need to adopt a sense of ""continuous education."" Google has made great efforts to ensure that marketers have the latest information on new updates regarding digital marketing, as well as provide free tools to enhance one's understanding of this information. Google does this by providing individuals with certifications that are valid until the period in which the product area of the certification expires. Though these certifications are bound by time constraints, this timeframe is only set in place to ensure that all information is renewed in regard to the respective product area. Google certifications are a great tool for future marketers, as they not only teach individuals the basics but also provide a strong foundation for future experimentation. A prime example of how these certifications can aid in enhancing a marketer's continuous education would be Google's latest announcement concerning their certification priorities for 2022. These priorities include new information on automation, measurement, and privacy. Privacy is an especially important topic, as many face the decision of whether marketing strategies should shift from behavioral advertising to contextual targeting. This is a particularly hot topic, as many are trying to adapt to the upcoming privacy-adjusted era.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,240,1327

Thank you for sharing the interesting articles! I couldn't agree with your sentiments more. If you had asked me several years ago if I thought that influencers would be such a popular, lucrative career choice, I wouldn't have believed it. However, as you shared, influencers are becoming only more common as a marketing method to reach targeted audiences. I agree that TikTok has catapulted companies' dependence on influencers. That said, Instagram and YouTube are following closely behind with their own slew of influencers.<br />

<br />
You are probably right. These days I get an ad in every video I watch from my favorite content creators. However, like traditional ads, I almost always skip them. The only way I will watch the ad, much less buy the product, is if I 1. trust the influencer and 2. find it relevant to my interests. I think trust is the greatest source of value offered by influencers. I trust the guy whose video I am watching more than some random actor on a commercial. Companies that want to advertise can make use of this, and influencers can profit from it. However, the influencers need to be careful. If they try to sell me a bad product, that trust will disappear. Even if I do trust them, the ad won't work if it is not relevant to the influencers audience. Influencers, even trustworthy ones, are not automatic sales machines. Like with traditional channels, companies need to pay attention to which channels their target audience uses.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,168,774

<br />
I have a somewhat unconventional take on this topic. While I also used to not believe an influencer was a real job, I now see where there is a lot of money to be made by the influencer in these brand deals. However, with that industry taking off many of us see more and more creators only having sponsored posts, which is very annoying and has caused me to unfollow many of them because I am on the platform to laugh, not to get products shoved down my throat. Trends come and go so much these days, that I don't believe this will be around in the next 10 years. To Sara's point, I never see the other generations catching on and buying in to the influencers. Charli D'amelio was the biggest thing 2 years ago with the most followers on TikTok than anyone else, but now we hardly hear anything from her.<br />
<br />
As Matthew said as well, I skip these most of the time and, based on the number of likes these sponsored posts get from influencers, so do many others. Some creators that normally get millions of likes per post only get tens of thousands of likes on these posts showing that many people don't really care what brands these influencers ""support."" I believe brands paying influencers to sponsor their products is an ineffective way to create a conversion, but it's the ""in"" thing so brands will continue.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,242,1078

This was an interesting read and definitely true! I currently work in social media and influencer relations, and I can see it growing in just my time working. Influencing has become a full time job for many and with that become a lucrative business. TikTok has changed the world of influencing, and it's becoming increasing hard to see what is an advertisement and what is genuine appreciation by content creators. Through this increase in influencer marketing, I wonder what will separate the growing number of them as the market gets more and more saturated. Eventually there will be a shift toward something else. I believe a great example of this can be see with Youtube. Growing up I can remember Youtubers with HUGE followings that seem almost celebrity like with cult followers, but in recent years the culture of Youtube has almost died off leaving those people pretty normal. Influencing as popular as it's becoming definitely has a life-span until the next best thing arrives.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,167,832

This is an interest post that shows how different generation utilize social medias to their likings. Even if the younger generations are migrating away from Facebook, I don't think Facebook/Meta is in too much of a trouble. Yes, our generation is moving away from Facebook...to Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. Instagram is so well advertised and positioned to appeal to us younger generations. It includes more visual posts and so many options to make your posts appealing to your followers. The really two contenders for Meta on the social media side right now are Tik Tok and Snapchat. However, with the inclusion of Insta Stories and Insta Reels, there isn't that much of a difference among the firms. One can easily argue that each company might have certain unique strength that would drive an user to a certain app. In the end however, they are all pretty much similar. Instagram is still ahead because it basically has everything Tik Tok and Snapchat has, plus its own regular posting feature. Even if the interest is slowing down and Mark is attempting to break into the Metaverse, I doubt Facebook or Instagram will go anywhere.

Using Meta as a way to gain back a younger user base was a bold move and I am not so sure that it will work as well as they anticipated.

This is a really interesting point! I find myself questioning the extent to which AI can mimic human behavior too! As someone who appreciates traditional forms of art, as well as the new digital mediums in place, I often wonder if AI will consume traditional forms of creativity. My brand promotion professor introduced the class to an article written using AI, he told us all he needed to do was input some keywords and fix a few phrases so that it sounded more like a person wrote it and the final result was a fully researched article written using AI. I think the startling realization for many of us was that no one would have never known a robot wrote the article if they were never told. My professor also asked our class if we believe that traditional creativity will be obsolete in the future with new and continuing advancements in AI. I, personally, don't believe that human intervention will ever go away in the field of creativity. This is due to the fact that we will always have new ideas based on the things we learn and study as technology advances. I think it is also important to note, that AI would never be able to create such wonderful pieces of art if it weren't for human intervention. We, as humans, will continue to play a major role in aiding the advancements of technology because these pieces of work are new interpretations of work we have already made.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,251,1144

thank you for sharing this! I wasn't aware of the stage AI has come to, and I think it's pretty fascinating. I completely agree with Maryam's point on the advancement of AI, and the necessity to keep people in any job/industry that is focused on creativity. To your point, AI does give us a bit more uncertainty about the demand for us on the job market (in a long-term future), but it is also true that it is thanks to this technology that we can avoid doing repetitive and mechanical tasks. I recently watched some interviews and documentaries related to the topic, and many researchers are aware of the potential that AI has in many fields (business included), and understanding the best way to control this powerful tool has become a very relevant concern.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,136,636

Funnily enough, I was thinking about talking about AI but you already beat me to it! I have always been fascinated by AI and wondered to what lengths it will grow. This right here shows how much AI has grown over the years. It feels like just yesterday we were talking about how robots will take over our jobs and now here they are winning our art contests! Personally, I believe that we may have an issue in the near future when it comes to AI. When I say near future I am thinking more about our grandchildren's lifetime. While AI is very advanced now I doubt that it will take our world by storm anytime soon. As for right now, I think it is very important for the world as a whole to start thinking of ways to combat job loss due to AI. The simplest way to do that is to create jobs to keep the AI in check and make sure that there are no errors in their systems. That is why IT is becoming more and more important these days. As for the creativity behind marketing, I don't believe it will die with AI. Creativity is a core human function that is extremely difficult to replicate. While this art piece shows the beauty behind AI art, it has no meaning to it. There is no story behind what the AI did. That is what art is about they tell a story through the mediums used in the process of making art. This piece was created at the command of a human there is no story behind it other than the prompt the AI was given. I am not denying that AI will eventually evolve to show creativity, but I definitely don't think it will be any time soon.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,304,1253

This graph and topic are super interesting. It is crazy to think that Tik Tok which is relatively new is surpassing Facebook which has been around for years. I feel like the trend towards more marketing spending on Tik Tok is due to the convenience and engagement of the app. The videos that are shown are only about 15-60 seconds long which would captivate a human and works well with the average attention span. I also think that Tik Tok does a great job of curating ""for you"" pages for its users that customize a series of videos based on previous views. If I were a business that sold game day outfits I would want to promote that clothing on Tik Tok because I know that algorithm will bring young college girls to the page/ could be shown on their ""for you"" page. Tik Tok has the capability of working with companies because of the not so random generated ""for you"" page.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,164,724

I enjoyed reading your discussion post! It sounds like it was a great summer of learning and insight as you designed the Statesville Convention and Visitors Bureau's website. As you mentioned, the ""Design for Usability"" is extremely important when creating a website to make sure users can effectively navigate through the different pages. One thing under that section I found interesting was making obvious what is clickable. I think this point can also be applied to emails as well. In my internship this past summer, I did not get the opportunity to be hands-on designing a website, but I did get to have a part in designing emails for different companies. Having a clear ""CTA"" draws users in to your webpage, product, or service. That leads into the importance of having a conversion-centered design for a website.

your internship seems to have been truly helpful! I think your post was very interesting, and for my experience I find it very relatable. I had to go through a couple of websites during last Spring semester and this summer, and I understood how important Usability is, as a criteria for Web Design. In fact, every time I come across a website that is hard to interact with, regardless of its aesthetics, I find that it's almost never a good customer experience. In fact, as the web is accessible to everyone in today's world, all websites should be designed with everybody in mind. Moreover, I think that one of the points we discussed in class is extremely important - people's attention span must stay the most highlighted criteria, when creating or updating a website. Only with a well-thought-through design, can we give an optimal customer experience, and exploit the website to deliver all the values we consider fundamental to our business!</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,162,796

<br />
To me, Metaverse always sounds exactly what I would see from a blockbuster sci-fi movies that would get me excited for the future. However, I can't help but question the practicality of working and being in a completely virtual world. For one, you would need a VR/AR system to truly experience it. You can have a computer and just use your usual mouse and keyboard to interact with the world, but that feels like you take away the main value proposition of it. Like you have mentioned, it is a costly system for both the consumers and businesses. It currently costs at least $400 to have a VR headset and start playing VR. For businesses, you need to have enough users to actually make it a worthy market to profit off of it. I can't help but think that VR is not the way.<br />
<br />
However, one argument I have against the costs is the existing gaming system. Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC all cost a lot. Despite that, there are still a lot gamers around the world who are willing to purchase such a system to play games. With that comparison, VR doesn't cost that much more. If there is a market for video games, I'm sure Metaverse will have a similarly sized market.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,217,968

Great post! I have heard about the metaverse a lot but didn't realize how advanced it is becoming, so this was very eye opening.  I think there is a long time before we start implementing it into our everyday lives. As Johnny said above, the costs of VR is currently very high and will be inaccessible for a lot of people. In theory, it sounds life changing and innovating but in reality, it will be hard to maintain and promote into peoples daily lives. With that being said, if people are accepting and willing to try to incorporate themselves into the metaverse, it could change digital marketing completely.

This essentially refers to the video's basic information, such as the title, description, tags, and much more. If creators can find the correct 'buzzwords' to use that are related to their video, then their video will most likely do well in SEO.

I think this is a really interesting insight! I wonder if the U.K. struggled with the release of newer websites due to increased privacy controls. The European Union just enacted a law regarding the protection of personal data, the GDPA, or the General Data Protection Regulations. This enactment will definitely have a cascading effect on how digital marketing works today. I have a theory that we may switch to using more traditional means of gathering data to understand our customer base. This question will be especially relevant as consumers will have the right to submit a request to access, correct any inaccurate information and delete personal data a business has obtained from them. Consumers will also have the right to opt out of targeted advertising.

When TikTok began to show growing popularity in late 2019, Instagram also created a short-video platform to show their company's answer. Based on internal research data, Instagram understands that it has a lot of catching up to do if they want to continue with the competition. The Wall Street Journal states, ""Instagram users cumulatively are spending 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, less than one-tenth of the 197.8 million hours TikTok users spend each day on that platform."" Over the past four weeks, consumer engagement with Reels has been down nearly 13.6%. This summer, Instagram experienced its first ever decline due to issues with delivering personalized ads. Additionally they are having difficulty making a connection with teenage users because of TikTok's high popularity. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Through Instagram's digital marketing research, they understand their decrease in popularity and struggle to keep competition with TikTok is because they are not creating new content. Nearly all of the videos that are published through Instagram Reels come from TikTok first. Therefore, Instagram users do not want to re-watch videos that they have potentially seen already. As a result of this, Meta announced last year that it was ""launching a fund to pay creators a total of $1 billion by the end of this year."" Instagram has been on the incline again due to this strategy and is offering more unique content to its viewers, personalized to the posts they like and things they seem to be interested in. For example, my personal Instagram Reels consist of a lot of healthy recipes and meal plans because I recently showed interest in cooking on Instagram. Meta understands that although this strategy has increased their consumer activity, they still have a lot of changes and work to be done. TikTok continues to hold the number one spot for short- video platform in the social media competition, and the data shows that they are ahead by a long shot. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">In class, we have discussed different social media platforms and the various consumer generations in which they have success.

Since many creators and brands make TikToks and with the addition of Reels on Facebook and Instagram, creators will post two or three duplicates of the same content creating a need for users to really only use one platform to receive this content. Many of the Reels I personally see on Meta's platforms are videos I saw on TikTok weeks ago, causing more of an annoyance to me than any sort of entertainment. Who wants to see the same thing three different times? Meta should get creative and find a way to encourage innovation in the content creators and brands post on their platform to try and bridge the gap between them and TikTok.<br />

Speaking on Instagram's first ever decline, one thing I along with others have noticed is the insane influx of advertisements. It seems like for every two posts I see of my friends' tailgate pictures from the weekend I see at least one advertisement making the platform less enticing. I will also see posts from over 3 days ago at the top of my feed now mixed in with these ads. They have a lot to work on in their algorithm of how users see the content they want to see. As a test of this theory, I opened Instagram to see what the first posts I saw were. The first post was a picture of a friend from 2 days ago, followed by a Disney ad for Hocus Pocus 2 (which I didn't want to see to begin with, and now I REALLY don't) and a Honda dealership service department ad (I don't own a Honda nor am I planning on it).

I enjoyed reading your article and this is honestly so true! Personally, I often find myself using TikTok as a search engine and I haven't thought about how others are doing the same nor about the impact this has on the digital world. Like the article stated, sometimes when using Google to search I don't always find it helpful, or it can be difficult to word my search in a way that gets the specific results I am searching for. On the other hand with TikTok, it is much more personal and content is specifically curated towards you, and having that visual aspect helps as well in aiding with search. Not only is TikTok increasingly becoming a great resource to find tips and recommendations, but unlike Google, seeing something on video with a real-life person delivering the information creates a more personal experience for the searcher. I think several aspects have influenced this shift from Google to TikTok as a search engine, including its more personalized user experience, the ease of finding search related content, and the fact that people value and prefer videos and engaging visual content. In relation to marketing, I also believe TikTok plays a huge role in spreading consumer word-of-mouth and makes it easy for searchers to discover new brands, products, and even local businesses.

I found your post very interesting and as I was looking through the forum it caught my eye. I am also an example of someone who has used TikTok as a search engine before Google. While Google is still my number one choice for finding information on the web, I can understand how TikTok is growing in competition in this aspect. When I travel I often search on TikTok for restaurant recommendations and when I am at home I search for recipes because it gives me a visual on what the meal should look like. It is a fast, easy, and reliable source of information for these topics. On the other hand, if I were searching for information on a topic such as politics, I would search on Google before I would think to check TikTok. <br />
I would agree that TikTok is more enticing to younger generations because of the dwindling attention spans. Searching for information does not take much effort, and if you are already on the app it can be much faster than leaving the app and searching elsewhere. TikTok has such a large influence on Gen Z and the younger generations, and this influence continues to grow everyday. I do believe that this app could take over many other social media platforms or digital sites that have been highly successful for many years. It is easy to understand, use, and is highly popular around the world. I am interested to see how many additional traits are added to TikTok in years to come.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,258,1162

I found your Digital News very interesting! While reading your post I couldn't help but think that I am guilty of using social media as a search engine such as Google. I relate to every statement you said. I consider myself a visual learner so If I can learn something through an interactive and visually pleasing video, I would generally go for that. However, I can see why this can be troubling as platforms such as Tiktok do not always have actual data that backs up the information shared on videos whereas Google has a whole system to guarantee that the pages they suggest to their users are relatable and safe to use. <br />
When you mentioned that over 40% of Gen Z users TikTok as a search engine and this could be due to the low attention span this generation has. I see why this is happening, we've gotten used to seeing videos that last between short seconds up to 1 minute and anything that goes over that time frame seems long and not worth watching which without a doubt has definitely affected our attention span. Maybe a solution to this is for TikTok and Google to unite forces and create a search engine that is designed in a video format.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,213,949

That was a great post above. I do agree that Gen Z uses TikTok as the new Google. I remember I used to search everything on Google. But nowadays, I search on TikTok to see if a product or service is effective. This is because people actually share videos of them reviewing something. This builds credibility and saves consumers from buying anything not effective. Another example would be reviews on platforms such as Amazon. Although the reviews with images are good, however, we don't know if the reviews are paid, or real or through affiliation.

After doing some research, one caught my eye that I never thought I could forget. Many brands when starting out gravitate to social media campaigns to build their brands quickly. This is the approach Sunny Co. Clothing took back in 2017. I'm sure many of y'all remember your Instagram feed being flooded with the infamous red swimsuit where Sunny Co. promised a free swimsuit to anyone who re-posted the picture of the suit and tagged the company. Boy, did everyone and their mom repost that image. With millions reposting the image, there was no way they could possibly keep that promise (even though it wasn't free; shipping and handling wasn't included). Many reported being charged the full $64 for the suit as well, and it ruined the brand's reputation. <br /><br />Their main objective was accomplished. A start up reached MILLIONS of potential customers in less than 24 hours. However, they were unprepared for the traction it would gain and thus their image is permanently scarred with the red swimsuit. This proves that the virality of posts can come back and bite you in the tail. Making promises you can't keep in order to reach a wide target audience will backfire in the end. Five minutes of fame will not make a Fortune 500 company most likely, especially with how volatile these ""trends"" are. Following a systematic strategy to growing your company through digital marketing campaigns in which you can keep up with will create a long lasting successful brand. To their defense, I'm sure they had no idea this one campaign would gain so much traffic. Maybe a simple paid search or sponsored Instagram advertisement would've resulted in Sunny Co. still being a topic of conversation five years later instead of something we haven't thought about in years.  <br />",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,327,1613

Macaluso from Omnisend talk about the power that email and SMS have as
marketing strategies. To be honest, before taking this course, I didn’t believe
the email was a tool that was still being used because of the fast-evolving
social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Tiktok, now consumers have
information at the point of their fingers so companies use these platforms to
reach their desired target market. However, Gabe talked about how emails are
still the number one marketing tool as they are used to tell a story and sell
an experience.  After class, I started
thinking if other traditional marketing methods are still being used now a day.</p>

<p>Before emails and digital smartphones, the content we see in
emails was found inside our mail box in 
print. Michael Plummer, author for Forbes Magazine mentions how “A
Direct Mail Campaign Can Fuel Your Digital Marketing Strategy”. He starts by
stating the obvious, which is that as of today, many mailboxes are empty
because as a society we all have gone digital. If we think about this, it's
more than true. We now receive everything in email like our  bill statements, receipts, invitations,
social correspondence, and more. We have gotten used to intangible ads, so our
instinct when receiving something tangible is to look at it, touch it, and
maybe through it away. But if we think of our spam mail, some of them we don’t
even get a chance to read or some go by completely unseen because of email
filters that are designed to get rid of any spam mail.</p>

<p>If we compare both, the cost of email is much lower than direct
mail as it doesn’t consist of printing and shipping. Plummer believes that if
we join the forces of emails and direct email campings, we would reach a new
level of effectiveness. For example, once the company has found its target
market inside a specific demographic it will first reach out to them through a
strong direct mail campaign of a service that is convenient for them in the
area they reside. Once the ad has arrived in their hands, the campaign must
include something that calls the customer's attention and makes them not want
to discard it, for example, these mail campaigns can also have a call to action
such as a QR code that once scanned can take them to the official website of
the company where they can sing up using their actual email address and receive
exclusive benefits. Now the company has successfully acquired both their email
address as well as their home address and a happy client. Now that the customer
has signed up, the email sent from the company will appear in their main inbox
and the customer will have more significant involvement with the company. I
think the way Plummer wants to connect traditional marketing with digital
marketing is brilliant.</p>

I agree with your response above. The class session with Omnisend representative was very helpful. I feel like email marketing is the most effective when we get emails from the companies we want emails from. For instance, we all may sign up for newsletters for other companies where we later do not want emails from. I also agree with one more main point that you mentioned above. I love when companies send email if they ask us if need any help with our shopping cart or remind us to buy something we forgot. I know that Amazon keeps recommending products whenever I open the app. Moreover, if I buy an item that needs to be purchased like every month, Amazon app recommends it.

As you mentioned, the email marketing is a great option to boost their sales and it is a good way to targets more customers. It is easy way to get more contacts through the email/SMS and social channels. One of the most interesting thing was that the welcome series is a really good way to introduce their brand at first to customers. Like the welcome coupons or sign up discounts.

<p>As we continue
to learn about digital marketing things, it is important to recognize the
importance of channels. We learned about search engine optimization in class
and how important their work was. SEO can help the business to build their
brand online, and it is helpful to reach their goals with it. It shows how
credible their companies are in the process. SEO works for all search engines
and using the alt tags can contribute to promote the company’s content
marketing as well. In addition, businesses can have better-paid campaigns with SEO.
With SEO, the company can reach more people and it allows to boost their sales.
</p>

<p>Another important
channels are use of email marketing, phone marketing, content marketing, and
SMS marketing. Those are enables the businesses to target the right customers
in all possible ways, including advertisements and also with remarketing.
Likewise, the use of a blog and newsletter can help the businesses to find a
new audience. It helps to bring more chances to target more young people
online. So, the most important point is that it is better to search SEO for the
continued growth of its business.</p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,192,1096

In 2021 Amazon spent $8.4 billion to acquire MGM film and television studio. They also have been spending millions of dollars on movies and the rights to different movies. However, less than one-fourth of the shoppers think that Amazon is a considerable provider of entertainment services. Although consumers are using search engines, most consumers also use Amazon.

In fact, the benefits of SMS marketing make it an excellent option for smaller businesses that can't produce marketing campaigns on the same level as large corporations. One of the main factors that makes SMS marketing so appealing to small businesses is the low cost to SMS campaigns. For a small business that doesn't have the same money to throw around like a larger business does, SMS marketing allows said business to either spend a few cents per text or purchase a bulk deal for a discounted price to send a certain amount of messages per period. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Even though SMS marketing may be cheaper than other forms of marketing, that doesn't mean that it's less effective than other forms of marketing. In fact, the ability to opt-in to SMS marketing means that the messages are reaching the people who may want to see your message most. Since opt-ing in to SMS marketing implies that the person receiving the message already has a connection to the business, you're targeting those most interested in the business. Personally speaking, I've seen so many ads across many different marketing channels that I couldn't care less about and ignore. However, whenever I receive a text from a company I allowed to message me, I'm far more likely to be interested in what the message has to say. It's short, sweet, and usually more relevant to me than most ads I encounter.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5705-text-message-sms-marketing-small-business.html<br /></p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,262,1334

Budweiser has recently released its official Fifa World Cup commercial featuring soccer's most prominent stars, people of all ages and ethnicities, along with various country flags and even an LGBTQ flag is featured. This is a great move on Budweiser's part because it highlights the inclusivity and diversity they strive for in the workplace. It is a great alignment of company values and marketing efforts and shows that the marketing department and the higher-ups are on the same page.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Budweiser has certainly caught a lot of attention for their Fifa World Cup advertisements as alcohol is under heavy regulation in Qatar where the world cup is being hosted. Budweiser didn't bat an eye at this and is instead viewing it as a great opportunity to promote its non-alcoholic line of beverages. This pivot on Budweiser's part is exactly the type of flexibility and agility you would expect to see out of a company as well-established as them. Budweiser also turned heads with the featuring of an LGBTQ flag in their commercial. This is because Qatar has recently been under scrutiny for its persecution of LGBTQ people in the country. This makes Budweiser's message even more powerful as it shows that they are not afraid to stand up for what they believe in. This showing should only positively impact Budweiser's image in the future as a company that embraces change.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://www.marketingdive.com/news/budweiser-world-cup-fifa-campaign-qatar/631891/<br /></p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,251,1332

Although all of these issues are important to consider when crafting an email for a business, the three that I think are most important are poor subject lines, failure to include calls to action, and neglecting analytics. Subject lines are the first things that consumers read. Consumers are less likely to open an email from a business if the subject line does not grab their attention. This issue is also a big problem because it doesn't matter how well crafted the emails content may be if consumers won't open it in the first place. Another part of a successful marketing email is its ability to lead consumers to click and access their businesses website. If there are no calls to action included with the email content, consumers most likely won't access the website because it has not been made convenient for them. Lastly, one of the most helpful tools for a business is their email analytics. These analytics can include the open rates, the click rates, and the numbers of subscribers vs. unsubscribes. All of these analytics are helpful for businesses to know what the consumers like in their emails and what they don't. Neglecting these analytics can lead to lower consumer satisfaction.</p><p><a href=""https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7101-email-marketing-mistakes.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7101-email-marketing-mistakes.html</a><br /></p><p></p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,294,1545

Recently Peloton announced that it would be switching some of its sales over to amazon. Alongside the announcement Peloton's stock rose by 12.4%. This was a hard decision for Peloton to make since they have always been a direct-to-consumer company. When the pandemic hit Peloton saw a massive spike in sales, but suddenly over the past year, their sales slowed. This is mostly due to Peloton having such a niche market. After the first year of the pandemic, it is safe to say most of the people looking to do at-home exercise already purchased one of their bikes. Another factor was the fact that a lot of people were going back to work, rather than working from home. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">To combat this dip in sales they turned to Amazon, the number one site for e-commerce. They also completely changed how the bikes will be delivered to try and boost sales. Instead of a fully assembled bike arriving at the consumer's doorstep, now they receive a package of parts and assemble them at home. Choosing to sell on Amazon is probably one of the biggest decisions a company can make in order to boost sales. It may not seem like a marketing tactic, but I would argue the contrary. Selling on Amazon allows the consumer to have the benefits of ordering on Amazon such as returns and Exchanges if they do not like the product. The one major downside to selling on Amazon is that consumers get to see all of the other competitors and compare prices. It's a win-lose situation, either way, the only difference is that more people will see your product on Amazon rather than on your own website.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Personally, I think Peloton made the right decision by choosing to sell on Amazon. The only thing I want to know is how they are going to try and grow their brand to become a larger presence on Amazon. I'm only asking this because Peloton bikes are more of a one-and-done purchase, what could they produce to make more consumers coming back to them?</p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,354,1727

<p>The article illustrates why TikTok is a good
platform for Search Engine Optimization. It makes clear the platform provides an interesting
opportunity for marketers and brands alike since it is not yet saturated with
marketers. Also, TikTok has low competition because of the advantage of primacy
in the short form video space. The challenge for influencers and
advertisers is to determine how to create number 1 ranked content and stay
relevant. Search engine optimization for TikTok must rely on back-end analytics
to identify the content consumers are most interested in and viewing. It then
presents that data to marketers and influencers so that they can tailor their
content to consumer interests. The influencers with the most relevant content
related to consumer searches will be presented first in response to searches. SEO
will help build a strong brand presence, generate targeted traffic and leads

<br />
This is a really interesting article! I, personally, don't turn to TikTok because I don't think it has become a reliable source yet, but I have seen some of my friends and family members turn to TikTok as a trusted source. This platform truly caters to shortened attention spans and fast information. The correlation between fast and immediate content has made many other platforms amp up their marketing methods by implementing new features, such as Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. Though I don't believe TikTok will hold the same credibility as YouTube, I do wonder how many people will start using this application as more than a tool to film short fun videos. SEO does provide a tailored element that aids in potential research, but this still doesn't verify if the information is trusted or not. I think a lot of users on the platform use an array of hashtags to implement SEO, but again I don't know if these tactics are polished enough to replace YouTube. Overall, I find that this article is very interesting and stands as a question that we will be presented with many applications that don't provide fast constant content.</div>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,197,950

The differentiation between Google and Tiktok is the user-filled content. Tiktok allows you to see another human and relate to a topic. This gives more personal meaning to a search. I will also say that Tiktok is a great place to start with exploring SEO since it is younger than Google. It also will help narrow down niches like Youtube.

Gabe discusses the proper way to conduct email marketing and communications to consumers. The topics are very similar to our course content regarding email marketing. The first topic discussed are how to set up triggers for emails and the best way to customize the triggers based on how long each consumer has been on the website and how often the consumer visits the website. It was also mentioned that emails are a very good way convey your brand to consumers that may not yet be aware of what your company does and how your company operates. For example, you could send an email stating that you will be reaching out once a week or biweekly to keep them informed on changes within the organization to build a relationship with the new potential consumer. This would be done either after or during the initial messaging that conveys information about who your company is and what your goals are.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">The podcast also covers the small change in the market where some consumers are not looking to amazon for purchases but instead going directly to the businesses websites to reduce emissions produced while shipping any purchased items. This was very interesting as we all learned in class over 60% of online shopping has been through the Amazon service within recent years. Some consumers are taking a stand and going green by intentionally reducing the fossil fuels that are required to for their shopping. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">The final similarity from this article, that I will cover, is the use of discounts while a consumer is checking out. The exchange of a 10% reduction in cost for the addition of a new contact to the email list is well worth it in the long run. It is a very cheap way to establish a new consumer acquisition, which typically requires a large financial investments from other sources (TV ads, Radio, etc.).</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">This was a great listen and I would highly recommend the podcast as it relates to a multitude of topics that are covering in our course.

They believe that marketing using email is a relic of the past. This may be true to some extent as alternative marketing methods such as social media are dominating the current digital marketing industry. Even still, email marketing can still be a useful resource to promote, engage, and sell products and services to potential customers. This requires email marketing to keep up with present technology and marketing methods and to evolve with the current trends in digital marketing. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">One example of a change to email marketing is the use of individualized emails. Traditional digital marketing utilized email lists and a one-email format to send to all recipients. This might have worked in the past but is certainly less successful in our digital tracking environment. If a company doesn't tailor its emails to specific demographics, its competitors will. And its competitors will gain the upper hand. Email marketing has recently shifted to begin using customer data to send more personalized emails to customers instead of a widespread singular email list.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Another change is the compatibility of email with phones. With the rise of smartphones, 55% of emails nowadays are read from a smartphone. This requires companies to not only create email templates that are compatible with 4-6 inch screens but also push notifications. First of all, formatting emails that can be opened on both smartphone, computer, and tablet screens requires companies to push for more phone-friendly email templates and designs. Push notifications only display a few words of the email to the phone's notification screen, this requires companies to format their emails in a way where the important words are at the forefront where they can be read from a push notification. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""https://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/disruptors-to-future-of-email-marketing/"">https://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/disruptors-to-future-of-email-marketing/</a><br /></p>",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,296,1632

I agree that the way marketers send emails could be more personal and create more of a relationship with the potential customer. Sending large block emails does not seem to get customers coming back. I think that the 55% of emails being read from smartphones is only going to increase in the next decade so changing format to fit smartphones is very important for continual growth.
