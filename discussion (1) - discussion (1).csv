Let’s start with the absolute worst email imaginable released by Adidas in 2017. In 2017, Adidas sent out an email with the subject line “Congrats, you survived the Boston Marathon!”. After the horrific Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 that claimed the lives of 3 people and injured 264 more, this came across as incredibly thoughtless and tone-deaf. Adidas released a public apology across its social media platforms. While Adidas recovered from this email faux pas, this may have been the end for smaller businesses if they made this marketing mistake. So, let's talk about another insensitive email mistake made by Amazon. In 2017, Amazon alerted its customers via email that purchases has been made from their baby registry, even though most people receiving the email had never made a baby registry, or even planned to make one. Some people ignored the email mishap, but it quickly became clear that the email was triggering and distasteful to anyone who ever struggled with infertility. Amazon quickly released an apology email, but this didn’t stop angry customers from venting on social media. Lastly, the article features a test integration email made by HBO Max. The subject line of the email said “Integration Test Email #1” with the body message reading “This template is used for integration tests only”. Those who received the test email flocked to social media immediately to mock the platform for their mistake, joking that it was an intern that made the email. HBO released a statement to their social media apologizing for the obvious mistakenly sending the email and leaned into the joke that it indeed was in intern and that they’re “helping them through it”.</b></p><b><br /></b><p dir=""ltr"">Arguably, Adidas and Amazon really messed up, and HBO basically made a mockery of themselves. As we learned in Omnisend’s Gabe Macaluso, there is a strategic way to go about emailing customers, and these major corporations definitely missed the mark. My only positive note from these embarrassing emails is that HBO made the right choice playing into the jokes. A less strategic company may have ignored the mistake in the hope it would go away, but they turned it in their favor. All of these corporations bounced back, but this isn’t a luxury most companies would have in today’s “woke” age. Companies are held accountable for what they put out, and we’re not in an easily forgiving era.</p><b><a href=""https://bettermarketing.pub/top-3-epic-email-marketing-fails-from-major-corporations-5c25d2250910"">https://bettermarketing.pub/top-3-epic-email-marketing-fails-from-major-corporations-5c25d2250910</a> </b><br /><br /><p></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,425,2223

<br />
I really enjoyed reading through your post! I agree. Companies are held accountable for their actions, especially when it comes to emailing customers. Major corporations like Adidas, Amazon, and HBO have all made insensitive emailing mistakes that have caused them to lose both customers and money. While these companies were able to recover, not all businesses have been as fortunate. <br />
<br />
With that said, I think these examples serve as a warning to other companies. Not only do companies need to stay in the know of current events and check for errors in their email marketing, but they also need to apply these best practices to all channels of marketing. Whether on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, website, or PPC, companies need to ensure that what they are presenting to the world will not lead to embarrassment and upset. <br />

<br />
This is a really interesting article! I think that email marketing is one of the more difficult methods of communicating with your audience. One challenge to learning email marketing is learning to think of email differently. Another challenge is writing a message that appeals to an audience rather than one individual, as most people are used to email. You also need to learn to use tools for scheduling, automating email blasts, and collecting and interpreting data. Email Marketers also devise a strategy for reaching out to interested users and turning them into customers. Therefore, when determining what content to include in an email message, I think companies need to tailor their market segmentation and algorithmic methods to ensure ideal emails are sent and opened by consumers! Overall, I enjoyed learning from past failures and taking note of how many improvements have been made since these failures occurred, as well as the continuous advancements we see in email marketing today!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,161,849

I really enjoyed reading your post and feel super bad for the intern that did make the mistake of sending out that email from HBO! It is so crazy how one little mistake can be blown up or wording something insensitively can effect thousands of people negatively. Even working on the campaign for Patrice, post that have one error can be used by the other candidates as weaknesses in Patrice's campaign. Even though there could be a majority of people that either don't see the message or don't notice, all it takes is one person to see it get offended and head to Twitter to cause attention to the mistake. This shows how crucial it is for companies large and small to proof read everything they post and to make sure their message does not come off as insensitive or could effect the customers view on the company.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,150,678

The one that shocked me was the email from Adidas after the Boston Marathon, as they are the main sponsor of the marathon which is also known as the top marathon of the 6 major marathons what happened back in 2017 was very devastating.

I really enjoyed reading this article! I think it is very important for companies to be cognizant of the message their emails are portraying. I was really shocked to see how insensitive the Adidas and Amazon messages were. As we learned from the TriMark speakers today, marketers need to always be aware of what is going on in the world. In this situation, the marketing teams for these companies should have been up to date on social media and world news. If marketers had paid attention to the general tone of the world after the Boston Marathon bombing, they might have realized that their message would come off in the wrong way. As a large company, they are very lucky that they were able to apologize and still retain most of their customers.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,135,626

The current trends of digital evolution seem to be moving away from email and more to social media. While email is passive and often ignored, text is active and almost immediate but can easily become intrusive. Social media, however, is self-directed in some way because the user seeks out what is of value to them at a time that is convenient for them. Modern marketing on social media and streaming platforms caters to the demand side by placing relevant ads in front of those users who are searching certain keywords or content types.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,95,458

I really enjoyed reading your post! I agree that lots of variances exist in the number of emails that can be sent over some time. Perhaps, best practices even differ by industry, business model, customer demographics or psychographics, and more. However, while there is no singular ideal amount of emails, businesses should at least send out one email per week to stay in contact with their audience.<br />
<br />
In my own experience on the receiving end of promotional emails, I often feel bombarded. So, the number quoting ""close to 6 emails per week"" seems like too many. That said, I would be curious to know if different consumers feel different. Maybe, for some diehard brand loyalists, nearly daily emails are the perfect amount while an email a week suffices for other customers like myself. For sure, this is an interesting topic with no one right answer.<br />

<br />
These are some really interesting insights! I find email marketing to be one of the more difficult ways of grabbing an audience's attention; therefore, knowing the right times to send out emails is essential! Optimal frequency is definitely dependent on your subscribers and your company; as a result, it may even be beneficial to test your email frequency. This can be done by starting with one or two emails a week and working your way up or down, depending on open and unsubscription rates. I think another key factor in calculating the success rate of marketing emails would be execution. To ensure a higher open rate, emails should have captivating subject lines, help the readers feel personally invested, and, lastly, be short and sweet.

<br />
Thank you for sharing your insights on email marketing. I enjoyed reading the three different statistics because I am interested in specializing in this area post-college. In the class discussion, we shared opinions and ideas on how many emails a company should send out a week. I agree that when I receive multiple emails a day or week, I likely unsubscribe due to annoyance or them being irrelevant. These emails tend to be promotional from clothing brands, which after reading that statistic from The Seventh Sense, I understand why they are more frequent. I had the opportunity to participate in email marketing for several different companies this summer, and the frequency of the emails depended on the content, season, and industry. Most, if not all companies, sent out at least one a week, which you found as well. I would probably advise on sending one to two emails a week to keep customers engaged and to stay relevant.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,160,783

thank you for sharing the results of your research! I think this information is truly useful for us, especially after talking about this topic in class. In fact, I did some research on the topic too, and I got the same answer regarding the absence of an ideal frequency everybody agrees on. As a consequence different companies may set up different benchmarks, depending on their industry, their customer personas, their specific marketing strategy, and other factors. <br />
As I said in one class, I personally do not like when companies send emails continuously, especially when it is clear that their only goal is to sell me a product, instead of making an effort to show something else (like lifestyle posts, corporate commitments, ... ). Going through my emails, I discovered a couple of brands that send me emails daily, with some days counting more than one. Companies should avoid doing this, as the only result, as you mentioned in your post, is that people want to unsubscribe from your mailing list. <br />

When it comes to larger organizations that have large followings on different social media platforms, do you think that they must follow these benchmarking steps regularly or should they do this more spread out over time?

Thank you for sharing this article and your insights. As we learned in class, social media is constantly evolving and it has become an influential platform for businesses to promote their products and services on. Monitoring what a competitor does on social media is crucial in learning what you can do better for your own company. The Social Insider article laid out an easy to follow benchmark strategy that helps set goals and KPIs. I think the fifth step in the model is one that can often be overlooked but is one of the most important. Understanding your industry as a whole on social media can help drive business and gain a competitive advantage. For instance, the pet business may draw on UGC to target pet owners who want to see real results and real animals using the products.

McDonald's is not only successful in executing their value-based pricing strategy, but their new marketing techniques have allowed them to focus on advertising, franchising, and constant innovations. A true depiction of just how popularized Mcdonald's meals have become since the release of collaborations with well-known celebrities would be when multiple large clothing brands used the Mcdonald's collaboration as an exclusive collection.

Your write up is insightful and it speaks to the newer marketing trend of using influencers and other user generated content. This is definitely a smarter way of marketing because it is targeted and mostly user driven instead of being dumb push advertising on billboards and TV.

No filters, no metrics for likes, and you can only post once a day at certain times. It's not a competition like getting likes and comments on other platforms is, making it more enjoyable and less stressful, and it doesn't consume a significant amount of time like other platforms. I don't see many people switching to other platforms for this new concept either. The other platforms are already so overwhelmed with ads and content they don't want to see, and seeing other's real time photos is only going to clutter the content even more.<br />
I do love some BeReal and I'm impressed with how quickly they were able to grow. BeReal has already become popular vernacular with everyone saying ""it's time to BeReal"" around you when the notification pops up, along with the use of the caution emoji the app. That emoji has become the BeReal emoji, and it's impressive how they took an uncommon emoji and made it synchronous with their brand and app. They also tapped in very quickly into the nosy people market (like myself) who are always curious to see what other people are up to. So in that case, if others switch platforms to show what they're doing in real time, I might just have to switch platforms as well to keep being nosy.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,282,1296

<br />
This topic is super interesting and I recently just listened to a podcast that discussed this new feature. I think that BeReal is a super fun and interesting app, but I do not think it will be around for long. The app is essentially a form of Snapchat where users go on and take pictures of themselves at certain times. Similar to ""streaks"" that people do on Snapchat-you have to send a picture of yourself to the other person before the day is over. I think the BeReal is a fun platform that pushed people to actually take pictures of what they are doing in the moment, but it seems that many people are just doing it when they are doing something ""exciting"" which takes the genuine aspect out of the concept. Just like most social media features I think that all of the other social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat will begin to include this feature because the concept is popular. I see BeReal heading into a direction of a filter you can use to post to your story or main feed and away from a physical app like it is now.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,198,865

Seeing TikTok of all companies attempt to jump on that opportunity feels a little creepy. <br />
<br />
I doubt that the TikTok now feature will ever be able to take over BeReal in that particular market; the concept of BeReal is that it's meant to be not your best self, and more authentic than traditional social media. TikTok in particular feels like people are always posting idealized versions of themselves or content that they've put a lot of effort into, which is the antithesis of what BeReal stands for.

As you mentioned above, TikTok has grown into a viral sensation and is still exploding in popularity. It has become so big that many companies are starting to create their own accounts as a way to create new content and gain a new market. However, I did not expect TikTok to try and replicate the success that the new BeReal app is experiencing. I feel like TikTok already has a great platform for creators to make their own content and that they don't need to expand into other areas. Users that have BeReal likely have TikTok as well, so they aren't losing their user base to BeReal. I find it hard to believe that many people will use the new TikTok Now feature simply because BeReal has a well designed and simple user interface that is both easy to learn and communicate with others. This trend of social media companies replicating one another is not new. Instagram saw Snapchat rise in popularity due to its story feature where you can upload a picture or short video and have it disappear in 24 hours. Instagram wanted to add this feature and also named it stories so that users could do the same or share a post. For the time being I think it is safer for TikTok not to over pursue this new idea and stick to what has made them successful.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,258,1129

I find this article and topic really interesting! I have seen the new TikTok feature pop up when I first open the app but have never used it. I don't think that many people will leave BeReal for the new TikTok feature because of how unique BeReal is. Using BeReal, we are able to see relatable and unedited pictures of brands and our friends, which is a refreshing take on social media. Social media can often seem extremely fake and unrelatable. Because TikTok still focuses a lot on likes, reposts, and comments, I feel like many people will be turned away from this new feature, even if it is supposed to be similar to BeReal. Many people use BeReal because it doesn't focus on any metrics, so I feel like they will be turned away from using the TikTok feature because of the nature of the app. As the other responders to this post stated, this situation is very similar to when Instagram and Facebook copied Snapchat's Story feature. I feel like BeReal's idea will get picked up by most other social media platforms because they see how popular BeReal is becoming. Even if they do begin to utilize a feature like BeReal, I do not see many people using it, especially at first.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,216,976

It is very interesting the impact that one new social media platform can have on all of the other major ones. When BeReal came out, it was very slow in the beginning but having an aspect that set them apart from other platforms is so crucial for the massive growth they are experiencing. Social media companies like facebook and instagram have a history of copying other platforms format. Snapchat had stories which were unique to their platform and when snapchat grew to the size it is IG and FB added stories to their platform. It will be interesting to see if these other versions of BeReal will take over the original platform.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,114,530

I think this is a really interesting and relevant topic. I've always disliked when social media apps try to replicate each other because of what is trending in the moment. In my opinion, it takes away the individuality of each social media application. I remember Instagram first doing this with their Instagram ""stories"" trying to incorporate Snapchat stories. I then remember both Instagram and Facebook incorporating reels when Tik Tok took off. Personally, I have never used the BeReal concept that TikTok has introduced because it takes away from the experience of BeReal. <br />

As a BeReal user &amp; a TikTok user myself, I noticed TikTok using BeReal as inspiration. People had been complaining that Tiktok and Facebook had become too curated, so the evolution of BeReal felt very natural to me. Consumers have been craving a social media platform without the pressure of photoshop or being boring. With that being said, it seems that all social media applications have been evolving in the same direction. All social media platforms seem to just be copying one another nowadays! I understand that they're trying to create a user experience based on what consumers are enjoying with other applications, but it's making the use of these platforms dull and uninteresting. This also reminds me of the Trimark presentation when Jeremey asked our class how advertisements would be incorporated into Tiktok. Advertisements will be the next step for BeReal to keep the platform lucrative, but then what will even make it different? How will brands even position themselves on the platform in a way that aligns with BeReal's authenticity? I'll be excited to see how the app evolves to attempt to keep interesting and different.<br />

Like others, I have also noticed on numerous occasions how social media platforms tend to copy each other. It seems as if every time a social media platform comes out with a new idea it is a ripple effect until all of them exhibit the same features. If it is not one existing company copying another, it’s a new company creating a social media platform because they like the way one of them works. They see the uniqueness and the success that the new feature has and the competing platforms wish to see the same results for their own companies. Instagram was created because of Facebook's success. Although they did not completely copy every aspect of Facebook, they did use similar concepts such as comments and likes. Because it is almost inevitable that a social media platform will copy another, this worries me for the success of BeReal. Like many others, I enjoy BeReal because it is so casual but I am afraid that if other social media platforms try to use their same idea then they will eventually run out of business. BeReal has not been in the industry as long as platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc. and it will be difficult for BeReal to prevent these things from happening.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,220,1022

Like everyone else has said, its interesting to see how social media platforms can start off unique and then over time integrate the same features as their competitors. Like Will had mentioned, Snapchat was the first company to integrate a story to be able to share multiple quick posts/videos throughout a day. Not much longer after that, Instagram and Facebook were using stories. In the grand scheme of things, I think companies try to emerge with a new idea and gain consumers this way first. Then, once they have a following, integrate all the other features other companies have and try and become the most used platform on the web.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,112,538

 The good thing about marketing on TikTok is you can gain more followers and reach your target market easier through the ForYou page, plus it's free. On Facebook and Instagram, you can boost posts, which is the most similar thing to TikTok's ForYou page, but it costs money.

TikTok also allows brands to advertise for essentially no cost. For smaller companies that cannot afford to spend a lot on advertising and marketing, this platform can seem very enticing. I think that one of the most important aspects of gaining a large following and awareness through TikTok is making sure that you are consistently posting content that users want to see. Most consumers want to see a brand being relatable and accessible. Because of this, brands should make sure that they are posting content that is relevant to their target markets and engaging with consumers through the use of commenting and direct messaging.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,139,701

This can lead to success as brand collaborations attract publicity and build buzz around a brand. As a result, instilling the importance of brand collaborations helps both brands to widen their customer base as the target market customers of both are combined. This process of outreach is possible as people who wouldn't usually be part of a brand's target market, who maybe aren't aware of them, will now be exposed to their products and services. Partnerships often drive highly relevant, high-intent visitors who are more likely to convert than other channels. Increased customer advocacy aids in people trusting the preexisting relationships of other consumers. By leveraging this trust, customers forge deeper connections to the brands they find via partnerships. Hence, enhancing why collaborations are a great way to increase overall outreach and user engagement. Therefore, in light of our social media campaign project, I believe that we can use brand collaborations as a potential tool for encouraging customer engagement and gaining brand awareness! </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><span>One question that may arise is the reliability of brand collaborations and if some collaborations may hurt a brand's image.  Though Ana Andjelic author of “Business of Aspiration"" answers this question by explaining that “collaborations are basically a constant brand re-contextualization: They take (a brand) from one context and put it into another one. In that sense, there isn’t a ‘bad’ collaboration: Collaborations are calculated cultural and business tests … the strategy of brand awareness, market expansion and its fountain of youth.” For brands in need of that fountain of youth, collaborations are easy ways to gain some notoriety or at least a second glance from consumers. And for those consumers, purchasing a brand engaged in collaboration is about taking a safe risk. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">One example of a successful brand collaboration followed by enhanced company evolution is in the case of Goldfish. The idea for collaboration began when Pepperidge Farm’s cheesy cracker snack became inextricably linked with toddlers. Social listening revealed a consumer request for “riskier” flavors, which would appeal to teens and adults. A need to expand beyond the crowded and restrictive “kid snack” category, plus a consumer push for newness, led Pepperidge Farm to develop a limited edition Frank’s Red Hot flavor Goldfish. As marketers know, millennials are feeling nostalgic and as they’re getting older, looking to connect back to their “simpler” childhoods. So Goldfish decided to up the ante as it relates to spiciness, and develop a line of jalapeño-flavored snacks. How? By partnering with JNCO jeans, embroidering the pack design into the fabric, and creating a PR frenzy. This collaboration was successful as it was driven by a strategy to broaden its audience, appeal, or ability to grab the attention of consumers.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><span>Collaborations can be performed with any brand sector, especially in terms of digital branding. This is due to the fact that brands developed to thrive in the digital world are identified as being designed to flex and adapt to their environment; therefore, the goal is to start with the ultimate iconic expression of both the brand and the collaborator. Overall, collaborations provide an opportunity for brands to take measured risks and innovate creatively while reinforcing their brands’ core equities. Success requires smart decision-making from both a strategic and executional perspective. But when cross-brand collaborations are done right, brands have everything to gain and little to lose.</span><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><span>To learn more about brand collaborations and how this tool can help your marketing strategy, read the link below! </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><span style=""font-size:14.9163px;"">https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/from-gaga-to-goldfish/ </span><br /></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,595,3299

<br />
When done correctly, I think collaborations can absolutely save a brand, in addition to being use to foster sales and influence the consumer's perceptions. We often use companies as an example, but this time I will use artists!<br />
<br />
The Weeknd was once an underground artist who had an decently sized fans for a new artist. At that time, he was still a myth and nobody knew what he looked like. Then, he decided to reveal his face when his next album dropped, titled ""Kissland."" Kissland attempted to incorporate his early style and some pop to appeal to both his existing fans and potentially get new ones. However, Kissland did not perform well as the team hoped, and it affected his reputation a lot and people slowly listened to him less. <br />
<br />
The team decided that they no longer wanted to maintain the underground-music-type to a niche audience and wanted to appeal to the mass instead. To start this process, The Weeknd collaborated with Ariana Grande for the song ""Love Me Harder."" It was a massive success for both artists. Ariana got a very popular song to compliment her album. The Weeknd was back in the game, and he received a lot of interest. This all led to the release of his next album titled ""Beauty Behind the Madness."" It was a huge success where it topped multiple charts internationally, including the Billboard 100; earned multiple platinum certifications across many countries; and won multiple awards including the Grammy, American Music Awards, Guinness World Records, etc. The Weeknd was back in the mainstream discussion and continued his success until today.<br />
<br />
This is one really incredible example of how a good collaboration can save a brand. However, collaboration isn't just a one time thing to get a spike in sales and the brand is magically saved. The brand needs to continue to nurture the new relationships and followers they have earned. Then, they need to continue to meet or exceed the consumer's expectations so they will have a loyal base. It is a coordinated and effortful process to get back into the game.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,351,1699

I completely agree that collaborations can be a very successful marketing tool and collaborative marketing is becoming more and more common. I actually did not know Goldfish made a Frank's Red Hot flavor, so that was interesting to learn. As you said, collaborative marketing has several benefits including driving brand awareness, leading to increased sales, expanding brand reach, growing brand image and trust, and provides an opportunity to build a larger base of loyal customers. With social media today, I think brand collaborations also build excitement among consumers, especially when seeing 2 of their favorite brands come together. For example, another popular collaboration I have heard of is between Dunkin' and the makeup brand Elf, as well as Dunkin' and Pop-Tarts. When brands collaborate, their audiences are brought together and it is often beneficial to both brands due to increased recognition and combined resources.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,146,803

<br />
When I first saw Tiktok's new feature TikTok Now I immediately connected it with the new app BeReal. I have heard a lot of instances where Instagram and Facebook have been accused of copying TikTok however I didn't think there would come a time when TikTok would start copying other apps. Most people seem to forget that the main goal of a social platform is to stay relevant, but once a new popular social platform comes, previous social platforms will take a hit in their followers. By copying relevant popular apps and trends most social platforms are able to retain their users but this comes at the cost of smaller social media platforms. So far in my usage of the TikTok app, I have not seen a lot of people utilize TikTok Now so there may be hope for BeReal. If BeReal wants to retain its user base and develop then they need to also expand on its services and come up with new trends so that once the BeReal phase dies out, the company doesn't perish alongside it.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,181,801

viewer is aware of your product/service, what can you do to increase their
consideration about the product? In this case, it’s very helpful to use a good
Landing page strategy and organic strategy which in TikTok looks like following
the trends. </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""> </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Third, you need to nurture the viewer. We now
know that before someone converts, they look at the competition to see what
others are offering and they might consider them, so in this step, it is
crucial to apply a conversion stagey and a content strategy. Know what your
target audience likes and how they can be influenced in choosing you over the
competition. </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""> </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Step number four is conversion. Use data that
you have collected to put your brand/product/service out there, and give
information to the potential client so they take the final action on the goal
you want to achieve from the prospects. Make sure you are giving the user the
content that they need. </span></p>

On this app, all users post a picture of themselves at a specific point during the day. Users are encouraged to post a picture of what they are doing at that point of the day, even if it isn't something that is considered exciting. In this sense, BeReal is trying to create a platform that produces genuine and real content. According to the article linked below, BeReal also ""aims to give users genuine digital interactions.""</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Because of the extreme growth in popularity of BeReal in the last few months, marketers are now trying to find ways to market their brand and products on the app. Although BeReal has restrictions against advertisements, companies are finding ways to work around these restrictions and advertise their brand. A company that has done very well at this is Chipotle. Using BeReal, they have posted unedited pictures advertising a promo code for the first 100 people that saw the BeReal and used the code in their apps. This strategy has allowed them to reach a younger audience and also appear more transparent. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">In the article that is linked below, they discuss various ways brands can utilize BeReal in marketing. First, they recommend using the app to post behind-the-scenes content, which can show a brand's sense of humor and increase transparency. Second, they recommend companies use the app to form an authentic online community for younger audiences. Next, companies should use the app to appear more relatable and real to their audiences. By posting unedited and funny pictures, companies appear as if they are more than just a brand. Finally, companies should use BeReal to get user-generated content. To do this, brands must engage with their audience and make them feel like they are part of the conversation. Overall, through using BeReal, brands can grow awareness and grow an engaged audience. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://influencermarketinghub.com/bereal-strategies/</p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,321,1652

I found your post interesting because BeReal can be beneficial to both small and large businesses.

However, we also discussed the morphing of certain social medias where they are copying exactly what the other platforms are doing. For instance, a few years ago Instagram launched their own version of stories which mimic what already existed on Snapchat. This likely drew people away from Snapchat because they could then post both regular Instagram posts but also stories, all on one app. TikTok most recently jumped on this trend with their ""Now"" feature. The ""Now"" feature alerts the user at a random time during the day to post exactly what they are doing in the next three minutes. This completely copies the idea of what BeReal is meant to be.

I completely agree with your position on this topic. Some social media platforms today are much more focused on matching what the competitor is doing, rather than trying to differentiate their own platform and listening to what their users want. As you said, BeReal is still fairly new, so I am surprised that TikTok is copying their idea so quickly. I also agree that social platforms that copy distinct features of other apps are harming themselves in the long run, as we see it happening to Instagram today. First Instagram copied Snapchat with stories, and now Instagram is prioritizing reels in efforts to keep up with TikTok and the popularity of videos. When in reality, these efforts are causing a negative impact as Instagram declines in popularity and usage. It is interesting because as marketers we learn to listen to consumers and match their wants and needs, when these social platforms are doing the opposite of that. In my opinion, I think people enjoy using platforms that have unique and distinct features. Lastly, this can also complicate marketing strategy as more and more platforms morph into the same thing, it may be challenging for marketers to differentiate content and strategy.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,202,1017

I completely agree with your position on this topic. It is very interesting to see all of the social media platforms slowly shifting into mirrors of each other, like snapchats stories shifting over to instagram and facebook and now tik Tok is taking the BeReal format and adding it to their platform. The goal of social media platforms is to draw as much attention from their audience as possible. The way for this to best be achieved, they attempt to compile every social platform into one and they copy all of the current formats. If Social media platforms just focused on what makes them great instead of trying to add all these features, I think they can just be who they were originally planning to be.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,127,591

I completely agree with your stance on this issue. I just recently learned about BeReal and almost right after I learned about Tiktoks new ""Now"" feature. I do have to applaud TikTok for being so fast to adopt a similar feature, but it is true that this is an issue that every social media platform has taken part in. As soon as a cool feature comes out it seems like every other social media platform runs to come out with the exact same feature. Personally I will continue to use BeReal for my daily random post while using TikTok as an entertainment platform. I always love when social media platforms are creative and come up with new, exciting features, but it does become very repetitive when the platforms begin to copy each other. I am hoping that in the future brands continue to focus on their own specializations and differentiation aspects.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,153,713

According to the speakers, paid social media is advertising that attempts to reach target audiences when they are spending time on their social feeds with relevant content that fits in with the channel. The benefits of social media marketing is that it's an affordable way to promote big and small businesses, it's flexible with timing and budgets, highly customizable to creative, objectives, and and placements, and you can reach wide and niche audiences. TriMark's strategy includes establishing client goals and KPI's, pick social channels and ad placements that fit, define your audience, develop tailored messaging, and determine optimal budget.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">TriMark also emphasized the importance of reviewing social media ads that are currently running with consideration of current events as well as how they will be perceived by the audience.

In 2017, as part of their Transformation campaign, Dove posted content of a black woman using Dove soap and ""transforming"" into a white woman.

When the whole point of the app is to see people's realness, being shown an add that was cultivated over an extensive period of time and has gone through many different phases of creation seems to stand counter against the app's message. There are only so many options that advertisers have when trying to make content for an app with such a niche concept that actively goes against the idea of advertising and planned content creation. As we have seen demonstrated in class, the process of developing content for social media platforms is not something that can be quickly accomplished in a matter of minutes or seconds. If BeReal does eventually add advertising to its platform, it will be interesting to see whether it allows companies to post ads like they would normally do on other social media channels, or if it makes companies adhere to the BeReal model of posting within the limited time period. If the latter ends up happening, I'm curious as to how many companies will be willing to work with BeReal's format to reach its expanding user base.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://www.ft.com/content/c19c486f-8cf2-4b74-a82b-978c45e2266a<br /></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,326,1650

I think this is an interesting new move for Netflix.  They would not be happy to hear this but it does seem like a desperate move.

This move will hopefully bring in new users and possibly bring back old ones as they compete at a price point similar to the competition.

It is indeed surprising to know about this strategy by Netflix as I've heard that they increased their pricing recently. It is indeed a good move by Netflix to increase revenue. However, as a user, I am not a fan of advertisements during the watch. I think if they follow something similar to Prime video, it would be very effective. Prime video does show ads during the screening but it gives the user an option to skip the ad. However, on the other side, Hulu does not let the users skip unless there is a premium subscription which can be annoying for the users. From users perspective, I would really hope Netflix does something similar to Prime Video. Overall, a fantastic post Tia!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,131,598

This was a very interesting post, I had no idea about this change. Rather than giving Netflix an edge over their intense competition, I feel like this change will just make a lot of peoples lives easier. Since many people will have Netflix just to have it, so I doubt many people will sign up just because of this, but I am sure many users will switch. Paying for multiple streaming services really ads up, so helping subscribers save some extra money says a lot about the kind of company Netflix is!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,94,415

This is a revenue-sharing method, just like long-form YouTube, where TikTok creators can earn 50% of ad revenue made from their videos.

Because of her experience as a teacher, it adds credibility for her campaign resulting in more educated audience favoring her.

I think this is a really interesting article! Content frequency is key, especially in regard to our social media campaign project. I believe that content not only helps you build trust and connect with your target audience but also acts as fuel for your other marketing techniques. It's the base upon which you promote your business online, so it's essential to give it the attention it deserves. Content plays a crucial role in achieving business and social media objectives such as brand recognition, thought leadership, audience engagement, and lead generation. It allows you to cement your position as a go-to destination for your customers, whether it be for entertainment, education, or inspiration. Though it is vital to post content frequently, it is also important to post good content. Good content is original, actionable, and answers a question. It's properly sourced, unique, concise, grammatically correct, and formatted properly.

Social media is an important part of everyone's lives and it is a place where consumers are the most influenced. Celebrities that boost product sales and increase brand affinity have a significant impact on their followers. They have the power to encourage their fans to buy a product just because they said so. Given that statement, I have a difficult time trying to name an influencer that increases public visibility and awareness for nonprofit organizations, charities, environmental issues, etc. Consumers are interested in the makeup, clothes, and accessories that influencers advertise, but I also know that many people around the world feel passionate about making a change. Influencers on social media have the power to push for a change on whatever subject they may feel passionate about. <br />As stated by Forbes, an example of this would be ""if a nonprofit’s mission is to support underprivileged children with monthly sponsorships. An influencer best known for her parenting content can help spread the word about this cause with specific examples of how sponsorships can make a difference in a child’s life, such as tying the benefits back to her lived parenting experiences.""
