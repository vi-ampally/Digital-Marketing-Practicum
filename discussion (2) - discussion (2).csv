<br />
I think this is a really great article! Prior to taking this course, I only ever used organic marketing methods. Therefore, when I discovered the potential of altering ads to be targeted toward specific target markets, as well as including the preferences of that market, I see just how valuable paid search campaigns can be. As a result, I believe that paid search and Google ads are essential components of successful marketing today. Paid search helps a company identify what its customers are searching for and provide answers that will be of high interest and relevance to them. In contrast, Google AdWords extend this aid by publishing ads and placing them in front of buyers on Google's search engine, where they will have a better chance of finding the company, product, or service, and inquiring about the needs and wants of the customer base.<br />
<br />
I think a big reason why I never sought out the potential of using paid search was because of the price. I was always worried about going over budget or spending money meaninglessly on ads that might not have a positive return on investment. Though, after learning more about paid search and how it works, I now know that this form of marketing is so effective because it works in both the seller's and consumer's favor.  This is due to the fact that Google lets you set key parameters for your campaign that allow you to control your spending. Google Ads work on a cost-per-click basis so that you only pay when somebody clicks on your ad. You can choose the most that you are willing to pay for a single click, and Google will not exceed that maximum bid. As a result, allowing you to be in complete control of your campaign by designating an average daily budget. Overall, I really enjoyed learning more about paid search and Google ads and hope to implement them in my future projects!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,326,1525

Thank you for sharing this article and your insights. I think a lot of times companies are concerned with the end result and the analytics behind paid search campaigns, that they can miss the mark on thinking creatively when targeting keywords. The Snickers example you gave (and in the article) was very clever and unique. They found that a lot of traffic came out of misspelled words. Something as simple as that transformed the amount of impressions their campaign got. One key thing marketers need to do if put themselves in the minds of the consumer or target audience. Converse did that with their ""Domination"" campaign. They considered what some of their customers would be looking up, not necessarily related to the brand or product itself. For example, the keywords ""first day of summer"" gained traction for their shoes, as you mentioned. Overall, I think getting creative with paid search campaigns is key.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,155,771

I liked the article you found! I love when brands get very creative with the way they create/display ads. I never thought that companies would get very creative in the key word search. I think with the converse campaign they got creative and took a risk by using those keywords to target a new market that's just beginning to use the web. It's very intelligent of them to take an inbound approach as many companies focus more on external approaches, but this shows how Converse cares about their customers and finds interactive ways to make an approach that could lead to potential purchases.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,105,498

Here, they are talking specifically about hotel ads for vacations; which they would choose to pause since in natural disaster cases, no one is looking for a vacation, just a safe place to stay. I thought it was also interesting when they brought up the social media aspect. A negative impact for Social is not just inflated spend, but also damage to a brand’s reputation.

This is an interesting article you found! As you pointed out, Kholer had planned a campaign with Trimark for a new generator that got launched during a hurricane. Many people had negative comments because it seemed like they were using a natural disaster as a way to make a profit. With that in mind, I am not surprised that other companies have faced similar difficulties when launching paid search campaigns.<br />

<br />
I think this is a really interesting point! I often think about how social media was initially intended to help end users connect digitally with friends, colleagues, family members, and like-minded individuals they may never had the chance to meet in person, and how social media has grown far beyond its origins, as it is now accessible on every platform allowing users to have conversations, share information, and create web content. There are many forms of social media, including blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, social networking sites, photo-sharing sites, instant messaging, video-sharing sites, podcasts, widgets, virtual worlds, and more! <br />
<br />
Though users are now provided with the benefit of reaching a wider audience, there are many risks associated with having a social media account. This is especially difficult, in terms of business-related accounts, due to the uncertainty of whether the customers will respond and engage, as well as potential targeting issues that arise when aiming to reach a new audience, making it unknown how people will respond to the promotional campaigns, as noted in the case of Kholer. With more access to consumers, comes more room for negativity. Therefore, I believe that operating any social media account, especially a business-related account, stands as a risk today if not executed properly. This is due to the fact that if a promotional campaign lacks clarity, there is not only the risk of negative feedback but there are risks associated with exposure and defamation. Overall, I really enjoyed learning more about the potential drawbacks associated with digital campaigns and think that this is something that we should all be aware of as we dive into the world of digital marketing!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,276,1464

<br />
You made great points about the impact that negative social can make on companies, even when it's complete unintentional. In the aspect of the Kohler ad, they were going for quite literally the opposite reaction. When looking at product that is supposed to provide relief, it is important to be aware of the audience that you are targeting. Being up-to-date on what is happening throughout that audience is the first step in that. If a company understands the real world situations that are affecting that company, they can better target their audience. When ad agencies begin to neglect conducting research, it honestly makes the ads less impactful and more expensive. When there is no return from the advertisements, the company continues to operate that segment at a loss.<br />
<br />
In terms of insensitivity, Kohler definitely suffered from this. Both the ad agency and the company should have halted the use of the advertisement as soon as the news and predictions about the hurricane began to come out. While hurricanes can sometimes be unpredictable, it probably would have helped them more than harm, even if they had lost profits. Their reputation among those areas of the country would have better standing than what they do now.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,206,1037

<br />
Thank you for sharing your insights on this topic. It was very interesting to hear from TriMark on the effects their Kholer generator campaign had on its intended target audience. When natural disasters occur, it is very important to take a careful and sympathetic approach. Kholer received a lot of backlash from their paid social campaign that showed people dancing, playing on electronics, and having a party during a hurricane. Although it wasn't meant to be insensitive, it did not provide the humor it was hoping to achieve. The article stated, ""the negative impact for Social is not just inflated spend, but also damage to a brand’s reputation."" I think this is indicative of what Kholer had to go through after launching this campaign. People from the community management side of things had to go into the comments and respond to people's negative opinions and try to mend them before the brand's reputation was completely ruined in their minds.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,161,806

<br />
<br />
I think that the hotel case is another great example of when ad campaigns need to come to a pause. There are several brands that may need to be on the lookout for situations like natural disasters to avoid negative backlash. In Kholer's case, they received a lot of backlash for not being proactive in pausing their ads, however, this can be a great learning lesson fo both Kholer and other companies who's campaigns may be affected by natural disasters. <br />

This really does go to show how big of a role outside factors play in marketing and why it is so important for teams to ensure that marketing campaigns are time-sensitive and non-provoking. I feel as though it has happened with so many companies where large marketing campaigns are taken so negatively as they seem tone-deaf. I believe that why it is so important for campaigns to have teams dedicated to how the advertisements will be perceived and for companies to look outside themselves when releasing campaigns. A large campaign blunder that always comes to my mind is the Kendall Jenner Pepsi Ad. Although these incidents are different, the bottom line is the public was not a fan of the marketing campaign that had no intention of being controversial.

I had a similar train of thought when we listened to Trimark give their presentation in class. It is easy to see how the commercial itself could be seen in a bad light but it was just unfortunate timing with the overlap of the ad airing and the hurricane occurring. <br />
<br />
I also really enjoyed the attached article as well. They're 100% correct in saying that each natural disaster brings along its own unique set of characteristics that have to be accounted for with equally unique solutions. One angle that I was surprised the article didn't talk about is natural disasters giving brands an opportunity to show that they care about the state of the country they do business in. In my eyes, the occurrence of a natural disaster is an opportunity for brands to step in and assist victims, build brand image, and make a difference in the world on a small or large scale.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,157,720

It seems that one of the primary goals for GA4 is to minimize invading the privacy of users while also expanding on the research metrics.

Everything that has happened with Elon Musk and Twitter over the past few months has been so much to take in. New ownership always poses risks when there is already such a huge following. This new implementation of an $8 fee would likely stir up even more commotion than it already has. Some social media platforms, like VSCO, have already implemented ""additional features"" for a monthly or yearly fee. Musk's actions would not be completely out of pocket, but it does seem somewhat unnecessary. Twitter is not failing, and it is indeed still making lots of money. There is no need to change something that is already working. I think that BeReal with likely be the next social media platform to using ads and marketing within their platform. While it would unfortunately make the platform less ideal to integrate ads within your feed, it is likely already in the work. Advertising is a way which companies can make more money and continue to grow in revenue. It is an inevitable part of the social media world!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,178,848

I really enjoyed your post! To answer your questions I think that the next platform that will have the greatest impact on social media marketing will be and I will argue currently is would be Tik Tok. Tik Tok has one of the largest age demographics across all social media platforms. It is incredibly easy to use and can be used for viewers enjoyment and for posting. Tik Tok is also very addicting as the videos posted are short and fit within users attention spans. Not only does Tik Tok implement ads within the regular curated videos on a user ""For You"" page, but influencers themselves are contracted to promote different products on their own pages. Tik Tok can also use users view history and interaction on the app to generate ads they know they will interact with. Similar to what we learned in the Social Dilemma movie this platform can manipulate users content to generate conversions and impressions. I think that Tik Tok has much room to grow in social media marketing and will continue to pioneer the way advertisements are utilized on the platform.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,188,889

You chose a great topic. It has been tough watching Elon hurt Twitter's brand image, the platform is completely unhinged. Things have only gotten worse too since you posted this. While a lot of this is tied to Elon's impulsive and erratic behavior, it also has a lot to do with him not being qualified to run a social media platform. There is no correlation between his profession/what he is known for and running Twitter. Just because he can run a multi-billion dollar company does not mean he will be able to run a social media platform. They are two completely different things and frankly he is in over his head. Considering all of that, I don't think implementing a subscription based model into Twitter would be a wise move. Even if the controversies surrounding Twitter weren't going on, I highly doubt many people would see enough value in Twitter to be willing to pay for it. At least as of right now.<br />
<br />
I feel like Instagram has been improving a lot over the years. The platform not only tailors advertisements for you, but they also have a unique way of showing the actual ads themselves. How they handle things is after scrolling through a few posts on your feed, you will see an advertisement and the smart thing about it is that it is a post. It doesn't have the same feeling you get from ads on other platforms/the internet.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,243,1109

I personally think that Elon's move to buy Twitter is not only a bad idea for him, but will also prove to be worse for Twitter than people realized. With his introduction to the company, it seems like so many changes are being made so quickly without the proper thought put behind them that a social media platform needs to be successful. Not only that, but concerns over these changes and more to come are rising from advertisers, as they appear to not be happy with what is going on with the website. Of Twitter's top 100 advertisers, half of them have left the platform and will not be showing their ads anymore. With all of the challenges that Twitter has been facing in recent years, this could serve to make things even more complicated at the company. Maybe Elon and the Twitter team will find a way to turn things around, but right now it's looking like this is more than they can handle.<br />

It has been interesting to see and hear about all of the changes that Elon Musk has been making to Twitter since he became the owner. Although I do not actively use Twitter anymore, I am very invested to know how successful the app will continue to be in the future. I do not believe with some of the decisions that he has made, but I think other decisions have been very intelligent and necessary. For example, I do not think it is necessary to charge users $8 per month for premium features when every other social media app does not require that. It is important that Musk keeps up with what all of the other social sites are doing because Twitter was already on the downfall before he acquired it and it will continue to go down if he does not make positive changes for its users.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,150,648

Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter has shown the risk and vulnerability of social media advertising platforms. These platforms succeed when there is a sense of joint ownership and community. Elon Musk’s management style in the first few weeks has alienated both users and advertisers. These platforms have to self police and conform to certain rules of behavior to guarantee their continued success</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,64,348

I would like further to expand your discussion of Twitter's profit model. Like most other social media, Twitter relies on advertisements to generate revenue. But Elon Musk is hoping to change this to allow for a more user-friendly ad experience. Similar to what Google is doing, Elon hopes to implement a system for advertisements to target customers based on demographic instead of individually tracking users. This will waive the privacy concerns that have plagued Twitter and many other social media platforms. He also hopes to implement a version of advertisement revenue sharing similar to YouTube. YouTube currently takes 45% of revenue made on video commercials, providing an incentive for creators to better implement ads into their content. Elon hopes to use demographic customer tracking and revenue sharing to allow for a more customer-focused approach to the platform and benefit creators and users alike. I believe that it is too early to see whether this shift will change the position of Twitter compared to other platforms. But creating more user-friendly features is certainly a positive first step.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,196,1037

I personally believe that Elon Musk needs to find a way to get a grip on Twitter. I agree that we should be free to post whatever we want on the internet due to the 1st Amendment. Although I don't think this is how we should go about it. Especially since he added the ability to just purchase verification. Now we have these fake verified accounts running amuck spreading misinformation about companies and causing stocks to dip. He needs to fix this issue and soon.<br />

As for what platform will have the biggest impact, that will be TikTok. We have already seen its impact in the music industry, new artists are popping up and becoming hits just because of TikTok. Just like these artists, I belive that as soon as we find a proper marketing strategy for the app we will be seeing new products pop up left and right.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,152,677

I love your insight on personalized ad targeting. It sometimes so crazy how quickly ads can be personalized on our phones and even our laptops. I sometimes get a little freaked out by how accurate my ads can be - even when I haven't done research about whatever the item is. While I think this take on advertising has the ability to become dangerous, I don't think that it is something we have any business worrying about. Technology is only bound to get more and more attentive to its users, and we are not going to be able to live without this said technology. I don't exactly agree with the whole ""listening"" side of technology, but I realize that there is not really anything I can do to get around it. As I have studied marketing, I have learned to honestly appreciate the creativity. As ads become more specialized, they are beginning to put the consumer first.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,159,719

I really enjoyed reading more about this topic! On some days I personally love that my technology generates personalized ads that are focused on things relevant in my life or related to previous search request or conversations I have made. As a consumer it is an easier way to find new products or services I did not know existed before. However, sometimes I feel that my privacy is violated when ads are incredibly specific to conversations that I have had near my phone. Recently I was discussing getting a credit card with a friend and a day later in class when doing the exercise of looking at the ads on the Better Home website I had multiple ads for different credit card providers.

I definitely agree with the term ""Big Brother"" ad targeting because it literally feels like someone is listening/watching what I do 24/7. There have been so many times where I have said I wanted a specific product and then it shows up as an ad on my social media. One night, I really wanted a Dave's Single from Wendys and ten minutes later I got an instagram story ad for a Dave's Single meal. It definitely freaks me out because they say they don't listen to you, so then I think it must just be a coincidence, but it has happened so often that I not longer think it is a coincidence. I think something like this could definitely become dangerous because you're dealing with people's privacy and whenever privacy is infringed on bad things can happen.

This is a very interesting article! It actually raises a number of potential questions, as legislation, regarding privacy laws, advances. Currently, our devices use internal microphone features to, unconsentually, gather data and create personalized advertisements. Though, I believe, this may interfere with new legislation instilling an opt-out feature so that consumers have a say in whether or not their data will or will not be collected. As a result, I wonder if consumers will now, truly, be in control of microphone settings on their personal devices. I, personally, always keep my internal microphones off, unless I am using applications that need them, but I still find my phone providing ads that are based on products I have spoken about in person with family or friends. I also wonder how this execution will take place, as many of us, seemingly, consent to our social media applications using our camera and microphone features, but are we consenting to those features remaining on, even when we are not uploading or creating our own content or is that initial verification, of whether or not the app can use those features, enough to listen in and take more data? Overall, this is a really interesting article and I am curious to see how these applications approach privacy standards moving forward!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,217,1107

Thanks for the post, the article was interesting. I think that it is nice how your phone will generate personalized ads for you, I much prefer them over randomized ads, but I have never been 100% comfortable knowing my phone is always listening. Just the other day I was talking to my mom about a company I was interviewing with and without an hour she was getting advertisements about them. I feel like this is different from being tracked on social media. since you could always just delete the app or get a VPN, but there is no way to stop your phone from listening without turning off your microphone entirely.

I can't help but find this article interesting yet disturbing. It's scary how much we're listened to, and how good companies have gotten at taking our info and giving us ads that are tailor-made for us. As convenient as it may be sometimes, I'd rather be comfortable knowing that my devices aren't listening to me rather than have ads perfectly designed for me based off of conversations. I've had experiences where I find a product I've never heard of before in the grocery store, and then within an hour of me seeing it or mentioning it aloud, I get an ad for it on Instagram. It's honestly very unnerving, and I worry about how much further things will get in the future. If anything, getting an ad for that product made me want to buy it less because I felt like my privacy was breached.

One statistic the article noted was "" 4.48 billion people log in to their favorite social app, but they also check in to an average 6.6 social media platforms daily."" This number is astounding to me, but it is also not that surprising considering how much time our phones consume us everyday. Marketers can take advantage of this by placing ads that are relevant to the consumer, and don't require any extra effort other than scrolling on their phone. Currently, 57 billion U.S. dollars are spent on paid social advertising. This space is rapidly growing, and companies should exploit different platforms to connect with their target audiences.

This article you found was an interesting read! Over the summer, the company I interned with found that our target audience was on Instagram a lot, so we produced a lot of reels or created stuff on TikTok and uploaded it to Instagram. Making a YouTube video was way too time consuming for what we were getting out of them and we found that the shorter reels were much more profitable. Not many people want to sit and watch a full length 20 minute video when 5 minutes will work. Aside from that, its crazy to see how much money goes into paid ads.

That is such an important and relevant idea that I think more and more companies are taking advantage of. Paid social is so modern, and it is coming into light more and more.

As reading material and online certifications are becoming more popular, anyone can learn as much about social media and paid social as they would like. Social media is making advertising more user friendly and easier to reach small companies. Paid social is a great way to link the large, intimidating world of advertising with those smaller businesses who may not have thought they were able to enter the realm of wide spread advertising.

Social media companies harvest user data from their platform and store those user profiles.

I found the article you shared very insightful! One thing I love about digital marketing is how it's constantly evolving and changing to meet customers' specific needs in creative and interactive ways and your article highlights this. Marketers must stay in touch with their target demographics to understand their needs and find ways to meet them. I love podcasts and more than ever, I see how different companies are contacting big podcast channels to create partnerships, even though I am a fan of them, I still think authenticity is important. That's why I also think that marketers when looking for brand partnerships should always have authenticity as a key component and find influencers that align with the company's values and target demographic.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,124,645

This is a very interesting article. I believe that brands that stay up to date with current social media trends can target and attract new groups to their business. Small businesses can also greatly benefit from following current trends and it can be a simple way for them to engage their customer base. A company that I have recently seen implement current social media trends is Chipotle. Their social media feels like a community while also showcasing ""realness"" and ""honesty"" as you mentioned in your post. <br />

I enjoyed reading your article and found it very interesting.

This article shows how marketing is constantly changing and as marketers we have to find ways to effectively utilize these changes and really connect with target markets. I also agree with your article's statement about how ""it's no longer about the flashiest marketing campaign""; following trends and simply embracing your brand's personality does a great job at building trust and loyalty with consumers.

This was a great article and definitely relates to our year-long discussion on social media's importance. I loved how this talked about podcasts and how live audio has such a significant effect, especially now. I have been listening to podcasts for a while, and more ads are starting to show up during them. Podcasts have become like a ""trend"" and many influencers are starting their own. This has been a way for advertisers to share their name, by paying the podcasts to talk about them. Social media in general has been a huge way for marketers to spread brand awareness. As we have learned in class, billions of dollars are spent on ads on social media. Staying on top of trends is crucial for marketers, and it's constantly changing so they need to pay attention.

As mentioned in class, social media has become a core component of our day-to-day lives and after watching the Social Dilemma, we may even be more in tune with our digital devices than we are with the physical world. As a result, I questioned why we are so entranced by these platforms, rather than our actual lives, and the extent to which we have a say in the digital lives we are living? Studies have shown that using social media can lead to physical and psychological addiction because it triggers the brain's reward system to release dopamine, the “feel-good” chemical. Dopamine is actually a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger between neurons, involved in neurological and physiological functioning. </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Therefore, when determining the extent to which social media interferes with one's attention span, a great example lies within the effects of TikTok. TikTok is a popular social media app that allows users to create, watch, and share 15-second videos shot on mobile devices or webcams. With its personalized feeds of quirky short videos set to music and sound effects, the app is notable for its addictive quality and high levels of engagement. This high engagement rate can be accredited to <a href=""https://www.intheknow.com/post/heres-why-tiktoks-for-you-page-is-so-scarily-accurate/"">TikTok's algorithm</a>. TikTok's algorithm focuses on the FYP (For You Page) and <span style=""font-size:14.8628px;"">recommends content by ranking videos based on a combination of factors, which fall into three main categories: user interactions, video information, and device and account settings. </span>TikTok uses machine learning-based techniques to understand what you view and why. The goal is to keep you on the platform for as long as possible and collect more data about what you’ve watched. “Every time you use the platform, the algorithm is updated with new data so it can understand you more precisely,” says <a href=""https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-data-privacy#:~:text=TikTok%20knows%20the%20device%20you,track%20your%20interactions%20with%20advertisers."">Jake Moore</a>, cybersecurity specialist at security company ESET. As a result, we may assume that we have complete control over our social sphere, but that's not actually the case. These platforms were created to ensure that we stay on them and not necessarily to aid our physical lives.

I found your digital news very entertaining, I think we all know this subconsciously, but when we read about it where there is scientific proof of how social media has taken complete control over our lives it hits even harder. I think it's very sad that many find more pleasure in a screen than in real life. I also feel that TikTok was extremely popular during the pandemic because it became an escape for many, a place where you didn't see the tragic reality of the world.

really thought-provoking article and perspective. The increase in algorithmic-based social media has definitely had a huge impact on how we interact online, and while it definitely has some pros to it, the cons make you wonder if it's worth it. On one hand, it allows you to be presented with more relevant media to your interests. But on the other hand, it allows for these various social media platforms to have more control over what you see and what perspective you see the world in. Politics are a great example of this, with echo chambers and toxic online behavior becoming all the more common. One can only hope that people grow to be aware of these changes and can adapt to overcome it.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,125,582

I found this article and topic to be extremely interesting to learn more about! After watching The Social Dilemma, I have become much more aware of how much social media controls my daily life. Like many people I know, I find myself logging on to TikTok or Instagram multiple times a day when I am bored and mindlessly scrolling for hours. Part of this is because I am constantly seeing videos or content that is relevant and interesting to me. Like Peyton said below, it is scary how well social media companies understand us and our interests. While I enjoy having content that is relevant to my interests and likes, I feel very conflicted about these companies having so much information on me. I think it will be very interesting to see if regulations or laws are ever created to deal with the amount of user information these companies are collecting.

This article and discussion really bring light to how social media can control us. I think social media can definitely have an effect on our subconscious mind. Many users watch Instagram Reels and TikTok because it brings relevant content and releases the dopamine chemical inside of our brains. When someone is having a rough day or week and needs to destress, they will turn to social media. This pattern is the same as an addict. The only difference is the substance that is being obtained. I think when the pandemic hit and people were stuck inside their homes, social media became a way to connect with the world, even for only 15 seconds. With black Friday and cyber Monday approaching, many people would rather shop online than go in-store. This gives companies a perfect opportunity to promote ads on social media platforms to create conversions for users. So yes, in a sense I believe Social media can have control over us. It only takes 21 days to form a habit, and being on social media every day can create an unhealthy addiction.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,184,870

I found the article that you linked to your post very insightful and thought provoking. It is true that we are more in tuned with the digital world, even more than our current world. I have also realized that most people have very short attention spans and this is definitely linked to social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels which show quick, short videos. It is no surprise that the reason we scroll past so many videos, we subconsciously do this so that our brains can release more dopamine. The part that is an eye opener to me is that the more that we stay on these platforms, the more information we actually end up giving away about ourselves which can lead to more time devoted to watching videos. This is an endless cycle that has no end. Social media is becoming so addictive that some people are neglecting their daily tasks just so that they can watch more videos-- even to the point of losing sleep.

It's scary to think about the effects that social media has had on all of us growing up. A lot of the times when new platforms are introduced it is super exciting and its fun to share aspects of your life for friends and family, or even strangers if that's what you wish. But a lot of times we forget that these platforms are tracking our every move and learning more details about us than most of the people in our lives know. After the pandemic and the growing popularity of Tiktok I noticed that I now have a very short attention span.

I have no idea how they got the information that I was watching the show since I haven't talked about it or watched it on my phone.

I found your forum post to be very interesting. I have actually watched the ""Super Size Me"" film and as a consumer felt the need to stray away from McDonalds as watching the effects on Morgan was very disturbing. I think that to a certain extent this documentary series could have done this experiment at any fast food chain and would have experienced the same physical effects that he did at McDonalds. However, because this team choose this fast food chain McDonalds was placed in the spotlight for their unhealthy foods. I think that the response McDonalds had to the series was effective and showed that they wanted to change and make a positive impact on their customers lives.

I have heard of the Supersize documentary, but I never really sat down and thought about how it would affect McDonalds brand image. I think it was smart for them to cut the Supersize menu, but I also think it would have been smart for them to add healthier options or emphasis the healthy options they already had like salad. I also think that they should have somehow gotten the message across to consumers that their food is not meant to be eaten for every meal, every day. I am actually surprised by the impact the film had on sales because I do not think most people consider McDonalds to be healthy for you and I feel like those who liked McDonalds and were turned away from it because of the film, would eventually go back because of the customer loyalty that McDonalds has.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,146,648

This is an interesting case since McDonald is never really known for being a healthy brand. Their main value is food being quick, cheap, and taste...good enough. For the most part, people should know that McDonald is unhealthy when they eat there. However, McDonald also put a lot additives to make sure people continue to like the food, despite its unhealthy effects on the body. They don't really attempt to address the unhealthy aspect of their food. The recipes are more or less the same and they continue to make the food cheaper, which inadvertently make them unhealthier. I hope they really do follow up with what they are saying throughout their online reputation management process.

I found this topic to be very interesting to learn about! I remember watching the ""Super Size Me"" documentary during high school and being very shocked at the effects that fast food had on Surlock's body and overall health. After watching the documentary, I remember being extremely wary of eating at McDonald's because I was afraid of the effects it would have on my own body. I think that McDonald's responded in a very positive and effective manner. By adding healthier options, such as their snack wraps and salads, I think they were able to show consumers that they cared about their health and wanted everyone to have the option to eat healthier on the go. Even though some of these menu items were not extremely popular in the long run, I think they helped McDonald's to help their overall reputation. Personally, I know that I feel much better about eating fast food when I know that there are healthier options to order. While I still feel like there are steps McDonald's and other fast food restaurants could take to actually provide healthy options, I think McDonald's response was a step in the right direction.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,197,940

I was very interested by your article about McDonald's impact after the airing of the ""Super Size Me"" documentary. Personally, I have never seen this documentary, and reading about it on your article made me think about the the importance of considering the risks from unforeseen actions taken by people against your business, or industry. I have also studied McDonald as a case study in the past, though for a different matter. In that situation, we studied the inclusion of healthier options in McDonalds' menus as a request for foods that would be more country-specific. However, your point makes more sense to me, as a documentary like this one can really have a huge impact on a business that is only focused on only one kindd of product- fast food. <br />
I also consider that McDonald's responded to the issue in a very good way, since they stopped offfering what was the worst option for customers' health, and they included new options that went further away from the typical ""fast food restaurant portfolio"". On the short term, what had the most impact was probably the complimentary pedometers for the campaign ""Every Step Counts"", as customers had to be made aware of the new focus at McDonald's. However, on the long run, the addition of healthier food options is what can help keep customers the most. Now that more people are aware of the effects of such diet, they can still choose McDonald's, while staying away from what they consider to be too harmful for their body.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,257,1236

I found your post very thought-provoking. Cancel culture has undoubtedly got the better of some celebrities but I've noticed that not many corporations suffer the same type of backlash that individuals do. Maybe it was because the super size me documentary was released in 2004 before cancel culture had reached its peak or perhaps it was because of Mcdonald's swift response to issues that were made prevalent with their menu offering. Mcdonald's profitability may have suffered temporarily but they were able to pick things back up quickly and continue dominating the fast food space.

I think that McDonald's has successfully turned around their brand image for the most part. While fast food is widely considered unhealthy I believe that Mcdonald's has dug their way out of the spot for #1. Recently they have been releasing healthier, more natural food options that change how people view Mcdonald's. Take a good look at their new chicken sandwich, it is a close competitor against Chikfila's sandwich and is surprisingly healthy at 470 calories. I love when brands are called out for their unethical behaviors because it forces them to make a change for the positive. While I personally choose other healthier fast food options while I am out, I will still stop by McDonald's sometimes to enjoy some of their healthier options like the sandwich I mentioned above.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,133,663

I completely agree Online Reputation Management is key to creating and maintaining a positive brand image. Quality ORM is essential, as it allows businesses to monitor their online reputation regularly. Since online content continuously shifts how people perceive a brand can also change drastically. In the case of Ticketmaster, I do believe that they could have been more apologetic of their shortcomings, especially because attending these events means a lot to fans and are even referred to as monumental events that occur in one's life. Therefore, an explanation of why their volume-to-capacity ratios are never exact, may not have been a sufficient response to console the losses that many endured. A quality response would encompass both elements of explaining and understanding the situation at hand. As a result, I do think that Ticketmaster could have instilled a more empathetic tone when responding to frustrated customers. Overall, I agree that Ticketmaster's ORM system was timely and explained the situation well, but did not issue a sufficient apology to fans, which could have easily mended many relationships involved.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,178,970

Great post! I agree that ORM has become an extremely important aspect that all companies and their social media teams need to get correct.  Consumers have an increasing connection and trust in companies and that means their brand image and reviews are much more meaningful for both groups.  Ticketmaster has received a massive amount of publicity based on the sale of Taylor Swift tickets this week and for good reason.  I think that while Ticketmaster may not have apologized for the issue of unhappy customers, it seem they were more just the bearer of bad news.  I do find it crazy that to fulfil the demand that they saw some 900 shows would have to be sold out.  This message and helping customers understand the massive demand for tickets is a way that they can show that neither they nor Taylor are to blame for such a crazy event.  It is not surprising that live events are selling out, people in a social media and post covid world now seek experiences over items.  This will be a case study on how live events and popular artists can increase demand and revenue for the limited live shows they are able to do each year.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,204,927

<br />
I have been following this story around Taylor Swift and Ticketmaster, and this case really show why monopoly is bad for everyone involved except for the company themselves. Ticketmaster directly benefits from the resale market and not giving tickets to actual fans will further drive the resell markets, where they can make a lot more money. Why make fees once from the sell when you can get the same fees 2, 3, or more times when every resell transactions happen? For the artists and the fan, they are very much aware about this issue, but they really can't do much about it. If the artist speak out, they are at risk of Ticketmaster banning them completely, and the fans really don't have any other way to get the tickets. Ticketmaster responses have been subpar. They are aware of these issues, but never really did anything to fix the problem. Ticketmaster and Live Nation should definitely be broken up.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,160,761

In this example it is tougher for big companies to get a handle such a large amount of negative reviews, especially when they are published on a separate platform from the company’s website. It tends to be easier for small businesses to manage their reputation because of their smaller size and small number of patrons.  They are able to respond to each publicly posted customer complaint. Some small businesses employ an active online reputation management program by sending a review request link after every interaction with a customer. This link passes through an internal funnel that allows the company to filter negative and positive reviews. The company uses this as an opportunity to reach out to the dissatisfied customer to resolve their issues.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,125,644

I really like the article that you picked, I thought it was an interesting read. I agree that ever since Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged, it has been harder than ever to find tickets for most well-known artists. This isn't the first time that  Ticketmaster has gone through this same malfunction. It is especially frustating to all the customers that kept getting booted out of line and losing their place - and at the end losing their potential tickets. Based on this action alone I do agree that Ticketmaster needs to work more on their ORM, especially now that they are facing scrutiny from their customers as well as a huge lawsuit. I also agree that if they had managed the situation better and put out a statement that outlined how they would fix the issues for a later time then their ORM would not be as low as it is now.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,154,690

nothing in common, are now a necessary combination for businesses. 
 This article by Spiceworks highlights the findings of a study conducted

This is the key to digital marketing, analytics.  Predictive analytics in
marketing is a key next step as marketers not only need to know what has worked
in the past but now need to make more accurate guesses about the future. 
The study found that marketers are having trouble pairing data science with
their marketing needs as well as focusing those efforts on the most impactful
applications.  The best applications of AI for digital marketing are
predicting churn rate, lifetime value, and cross-selling likelihood, which most
people are aware of since it is a staple of the Amazon shopping
experience.  The study found that no marketing leader responded by saying
that they did not want AI-driven models to help predict customer data.  </p>

<p>Some other obstacles that they face are a lack of technical
knowledge, convincing higher leadership, and the ability to work with customer
data that they have or may not have.  When marketers actually get access
to data scientists and models some other issues arise.  There can often be
a disconnect between marketers' needs and goals and how data is ultimately
modeled.  The study also found that the models that scientists built took
too long and weren't updated enough to keep the ever-important accuracy needed
for such important decisions.  </p>

<p>How can marketers connect the dots between analytics and
customer behavior?  It will need to start with organizational buy-in,

<br />
I agree, I don't think anyone could have predicted the impact AI would have on the field of marketing! I think many will start to notice a merge between artificial intelligence and digital marketing, as marketers start to incorporate the use of predictive analytics. As of right now, many marketers rely on the use of prescriptive analytics to aid in drawing specific recommendations to enhance current marketing methods. Though this is the case, I believe that this will change as technology advances. Even the use of prescriptive analytics collaborates heavily with AI technologies, as prescriptive analytics relies on artificial intelligence, specifically the subfield of machine learning, which encompasses algorithms and models that allow computers to make decisions based on statistical data relationships and patterns. This will not be the case for very long though, due to both analytic methods, predictive and prescriptive, being similar, as both inform your business strategies based on collected data. Businesses have also adopted many analytic software, with the term ""business intelligence"" becoming a buzzword within the last few years. Business intelligence comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis and management of business information. Therefore, I believe that the integration of analytics into the field of marketing has already begun, but we are still in the early stages of this adoption period. Overall, I think this was a really interesting article and I am excited to see where the world of marketing is headed as we evolve with new technological methods of performance!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,254,1395

Netflix is also giving advertisers the ability to target ads broadly across entertainment genres, and will collect ad-tier subscriber information such as birth date and gender to eventually use for ad targeting in the future. This reminds me of the expert session video about how much social platforms really learn about their users and in turn how advertisers utilize that information.

Great post!  Netflix seems to be a giant that has taken a large hit in recent years.  With Disney+ and all the other streaming platforms with the same idea, Netflix has lost its competitive advantage.  With this increase in the number of unique platforms comes the tradeoffs that consumers must make.  There are now too many platforms for a subscription to each to be a viable option for customers with a limited budget of time, money, and interests.  I think that Netflix will do well with this ad-supported plan that will both keep current customers as well as allow them to stay subscribed to multiple services at once.  To stay on top I think Netflix will need to create a new competitive advantage like a popular show, live channels, or some other way to stay popular and relevant.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,139,650

I completely agree! I believe that customer service is especially important, as it is an essential tool that businesses should ensure is prioritized. This is due to the fact that customer service is one of the few occasions where a business can guarantee that they will have 100% of a customer's attention when there's a problem. Therefore, it is vital that businesses actively engage with consumers and provide guidance on any issues they might have through social media, or other forms of interactive elements, via email, phone, etc. This will not only benefit the business's mission to promote a satisfactory customer experience, but studies have shown that customers who have their problems solved in an adequate and timely manner are more likely to repurchase and increase overall brand loyalty. As a result, by providing great customer service, organizations can recover customer acquisition costs, retain talent, and foster brand loyalty.

I agree with everything that you're saying here. For me, the two main points that cannot be stressed enough are the avoidance of social media and poor customer service. Considering how successful social media advertising has been for marketing as a whole, I cannot imagine why some companies wouldn't be jumping at the chance to partake in social media marketing. Almost all of the ads I see now come from social media, as well as just from digital marketing as a whole. Social media is always evolving, and marketing has the potential to keep up with it as long as companies are willing to put in the effort.<br />
Additionally, having dealt with companies that have terrible customer service like Spectrum, there is nothing that makes me want to never deal with a company more than poor customer service. I've had trouble with things I've bought before, but if the customer service is good and helps me out without wasting my time, I'm likely to stick with the company despite having an issue to begin with. If I have to stay on the phone with customer service for hours at a time because no one can adequately help me, then the likelihood that I stay a customer is near zero.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,211,976

I found this article to be very interesting, and I agree with what you are saying! I believe that good customer service is one of the most important things that a company needs in order to be successful. As we saw in the Spectrum example during class, it can be very frustrating as a consumer to deal with companies that have bad customer service. When companies show consumers that they care about their business and want to help solve their problems, it makes customers feel like the company values them and their business. This, in turn, might help the company to retain the customer's business. I also believe that social media is a marketing tool that every company should utilize. There are many companies that I have discovered and bought from because of using social media. I think social media provides a huge opportunity, especially for smaller businesses, to reach consumers that they never would have if they weren't using social media. Social media also gives consumers a chance to show their creativity and communicate directly with consumers through the use of comments and direct messages.

<br />
As a consumer and future marketer, I believe that opportunities can arise from minor setbacks. This is due to the fact that the current fear is that businesses will no longer be able to provide customized ads that are targeted and ensure customer satisfaction. Companies will now have to provide consumers with more opportunities to opt out of targeted messages from businesses or third parties to whom they have sold consumers' data. Though I believe that opportunities can arise from this ""setback,"" as we have done marketing for years, prior to the tech boom. Therefore, we can implement more traditional marketing means, with our enhanced knowledge of the digital marketing realm. In the evolving field of privacy law, there is an opportunity for marketers to build trust with target customers by setting standards that are higher than the legal requirements and by respecting customers’ desire for privacy. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this article and am interested to see how marketers will approach these new enactments moving forward!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,170,890

I read with interest your post about the European GDPR, and the answer to your final question is not the easiest. In fact, as consumer, I personally like knowing that the European government takes care of the data security of all European citizens. additionally, Europeans in general like the attention that is given to this issue, and don't envy Americans, for the lower protection they receive. For example, the growing importance that is given to consumers' consent to have their data processed, is an especially good layer of protection, since I can be aware of the websites I granted this privilege, and I can browse the web knowing that this choice is completely up to me. <br />
However, as a future marketer who will most likely work in a European country, I don't have the same answer. Having the greater limitations that the GDPR imposes on anyone who needs to process consumers' data certainly gives marketers a harder time to find an efficient way of segmenting their audience, and maximing the ROI to the levels of their American competitors. <br />
I am confident that the US will eventually follow the EU in implementing a stricter set of rules about data treatment and protection, so I think that European marketers will be soon followed by Americans, and everyone will have to follow similar laws, and readapt their benchmarks.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,227,1115

We also know that anything you put on social media is there forever, it doesn't matter if you go back and delete it because there are ways of retrieving it back. There are instances in which people state their opinion on something publicly (usually through social media) and they are met with wide backlash which can lead to them being ""Canceled"". When we refer to this term ""Canceled"" it means that this person has lost their popularity and respect amongst people. While we have been ""Canceling"" people long before social media, the adoption of Cancel culture is new and growling rapidly. Many people use social media as a way to get there thoughts out and unfortunately lots of people that use social media are angry and want to cause problems for little to no reason. This culture of trying to cancel people for the smallest of comments is starting to get out of hand and many people are starting to view some social media platforms as dangerous. There is the argument that people should be held accountable for what they say or post, but at the same time where is the line for what is considered cancelable? Cancel culture has even impacted businesses. Take a look at Papa Johns for example, there were old derogatory comments that resurfaced and caused him to step down and no longer associate with the business.

You are absolutely right. Cancel culture has been blown out of proportion. The idea behind Cancel Culture is valid in the sense that if somebody says or does something wrong, you should feel encouraged to call them out or maybe even bring it to other peoples attention. However, unless the person did something completely god awful, nobody deserves to be canceled entirely. They made a mistake, so what? Everybody makes mistakes. It doesn't matter if it is a big one or small, any mistake can be viewed as a life lesson that you can learn from. More people just need to be able to forgive, but not forget and move on.

Thank you for sharing this article with us. Yes, cancel culture is indeed becoming common nowadays. It is ethical to cancel someone for a genuine reason. But, I've seen on social media where some people cancel people just for fun. This shows that the meaning of cancel culture has changed. It was for the social good in the past and now it is used for fun in some cases and ethics in other cases.

I first started to really notice it during covid times, I guess people had nothing better to do than dig up old controversies. One of the major changes I've noticed in the post-cancel-culture world is the heightened fear of ostracism as well as the partial censorship of messages so as not to upset anyone. It honestly feels like everyone is walking around on eggshells, especially people whose lives were already in the limelight. I'm a big believer that you can't make everyone happy and that trying to do that is a huge waste of your time and it feels like cancel culture is trying to push that motive.  Personally, accountability is one of the traits I look for in people that I surround myself with and I think that if someone is doing something distasteful, they should be called out on their actions. I do not however believe they should be put on blast in front of huge audiences and have their life permanently altered. Nobody in the world is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, sure the magnitude can vary greatly, but I believe that cancel culture robs individuals of the greatest privilege humans have, learning from their mistakes. People need nudges in the right direction sometimes, not their entire life uprooted and destroyed because some person they don't even know recorded them doing something distasteful and posted it without any context. Outside of ruining individuals' lives, cancel culture affects the individual's family and friends as well. Additionally, another one of my gripes with cancel culture is that it most often targets individuals and people who weren't even involved in the first place make their best efforts to ruin a person's life who they don't even know. Why are we so focused on individuals, why not turn the focus on manufacturers and corporations? If people would bring this same type of energy to the table when it comes to holding corporations and businesses accountable for their actions and impact on ecosystems, we'd be a lot further ahead on a lot of our ecological and environmental preservation initiatives.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,358,1768

I agree that ""cancelling"" people is necessary in certain situations, but it has started to turn into a culture of ""cancelling"" people for the smallest disagreements or opinions. I also think people tend to forget that there are two sides to every story, and social media may not show the whole story. For instance, I have seen videos/posts of consumers calling out businesses or influencers for rude behavior or treatment, but then it surfaces that it was actually the opposite situation. It's a hard thing to discuss because some people genuinely deserve to be ""cancelled"" and do not deserve a social media following.

Social media companies should take ethics more seriously and demonstrate social responsibility in the deployment of their platform offerings. These companies should use the technologies available, like artificial intelligence to filter the posts that they present to users in different demographics.

I think you brought up a great point. I think every single social media app and website tracks what you’re doing. Though, I do agree that TikTok knows you more on a personal level compared to other social media platforms. Since TikTok knows what your interest are, your demographics, your friends, your weak spots, etc. through the videos you like, they get a lot more personal information than Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. I also agree that Google knows you more on a personal level.

I also think it's interesting how we assign less concern to companies like Google over TikTok. I think a lot of it may come down to how much we consider the service to be a necessity in our daily lives. While social media apps like TikTok or Facebook may not be seen as necessary for a lot of people, I believe that far more people consider a search engine like Google to be a necessity. Many of us know how much these services track us, but when the thing that's tracking us is not necessary, then we are less likely to trust it. Not everyone uses TikTok, Facebook, or various other social media apps, but almost everyone uses Google or other search engines. If the tool we use is so important and integral to our daily lives, then I believe that people want to trust it more than we probably should.

You have a very valid point asking if users don't really trust Tiktok, why would we still use the platform? In one article I read by CNN, many companies like Google and Amazon are trying to reach our demographic and bring more awareness about the brand. One reason I still use Tiktok is for the word-of-mouth products other people recommend. Tiktok has become a very popular search engine that can provide you with information quickly just like Google. Users on products like Google’s search engine are decreasing. In 2021, TikTok.com was the most popular domain on the internet, outranking Google.com, Facebook.com, Microsoft.com, and Apple.com. I am not entirely concerned with being tracked on Tiktok due to it proving ads and relevant content for me at the moment.

This is indeed an insightful post above. Yes, we did hear that TikTok is not safe in terms of data protection and privacy. Yet, most of us, especially students, use it anyway. Is it because we are not concerned or we don't care if our information is stolen? This is definitely a concern we need to put more emphasis on as it could be dangerous in the future. Moreover, you mentioned about the company Google also having access to our information. But, I do feel like Google does put up some data privacy standards that would protect our privacy. Moreover, we as a world would not be able to move forward if it not were Google because it allows us to be more educated. So, is it fair that Google has access to our information?

I agree that it is interesting how many of us pick and choose which platforms we trust/distrust when almost all of them track our data in a similar way. Of course there are a few differences with the presence of third-party contracts. But overall, any social media platform that you use in tracking you in some way. I think what determines a consumers level of trust for a platform is purely based off what kind of stories they have heard. A good example of this was every one in class rating LinkedIn as one of their most trusted social platforms because there aren't a lot of news stories or talks about how LinkedIn tracks us. On the other end, everyone rated Tiktok as one of their most distrusted because that is a platform that we have all heard numerous stories about and have been told not to trust.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,150,670

I completely agree with what you're saying. I can't count how many times I've gone to a website and immediately left because of poor design, especially in relation to ads. The design of a website is extremely important in getting someone to stay on the website, and if things just aren't readable or understandable for the average person, then the company that owns the website is doing a bad job. I think one thing that many websites do that ruins their chances of people sticking around is the use and placement of ads. Nothing is more irritating than going on to a website and being bombarded with endless ads that move the page around and distract from the important content on the website. Whenever this happens to me, I immediately leave the website and don't look back. However, when ads are tastefully placed across a webpage and don't disrupt what the website is looking for me to do, then I don't mind ads at all. Focusing on good design can change not just your website for the better, but your business as a whole.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,186,853

Display ads are a push approach, while search ads are a pull approach. Therefore, in order to increase brand awareness, companies should start with display ads. If you have a limited budget, then search ads are the best option to start with.  Search ads typically have a higher conversion rate. The last factor is urgent services. If your company is considered “urgent,” then search ads are the best way to go. This is because when something is urgent, people are more likely to search on the internet for the answers. Also, people tend to search emergency questions on there phone, so it is important to capitalize on this. </p><p><br /></p><p><a href=""https://www.investisdigital.com/blog/paid-media/search-vs-display-advertising"">https://www.investisdigital.com/blog/paid-media/search-vs-display-advertising</a></p><br /><p></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,177,905

The rise of this app is providing endless opportunities for marketers to reach large audiences all over the world. Because TikTok is becoming one of the most popular apps used among Gen Zers, it is important for companies trying to target these audiences to understand how to use TikTok to their advantage. The HubSpot article linked below discusses how marketers can increase their TikTok SEO skills and reach an increased number of users. Within this article, the writer states that the main goal of improving a company's TikTok SEO is ""improving the searchable element of videos and connecting it with interested users."" </p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">There are three main steps to achieve this goal. <span style=""font-size:0.9375rem;"">First, marketers should do research on TikTok keywords. Instead of only adding these keywords to the videos' captions, marketers should also utilize in-video text. To find which keywords will get the most visibility, marketers should utilize the Trend Discovery Tool to figure out what is trending on the app. By adding trendy and relevant keywords to the description and videos, companies are more likely to get an increased number of views. The second step marketers can use to increase their TikTok SEO is to collaborate with users and begin posting user-generated content. As buyers, we have a tendency to trust real people's opinions on a product more than a company's opinion on their own product. Personally, I feel more inclined to buy something if I see an influencer I trust posting about it and giving a real review on it. Because of this, companies should invest in working with influencers. Finally, the third step marketers can use is to create a hashtag strategy that uses relevant and explanatory hashtags. By adding more relevant hashtags to their video descriptions, viewers will have a better understanding of what product is being shown or discussed in the video. Overall, if marketers can increase their TikTok SEO, they will be able to reach an increasingly large audience.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tiktok-discoverability</p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,339,1763

I really liked your article! I have always been curious to know SEO worked for Tiktok. One thing that I found interesting is step number two: creating user-generated content. In terms of SEO, creating content alone allows users to see your page more. When I think of SEO, I think of keywords and trends. However, having more engagement with your platform builds brand loyalty among the users. This gives an opportunity for your name to be known and easier to search. I also found it interesting how the article mentioned having declared the type of mobile device you are using. I personally have tried using #3 in my internships. Using a mix of low, medium, and high hashtags helps you reach a broad audience. I recommend using low competition hashtags, so that you meet your target market with little competition. Which step do you think is most critical to increase SEO?</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,153,733

Reading about this new marketing campaign from McDonald's surprised me. </span><span style=""font-size:0.9375rem;"">While it should not come as a surprise that a giant company like McDonald's is trying to get into the SMS market, it feels strange seeing a restaurant brand entering the scene.

Unlike political SMS campaigns that feel like an endless barrage of texts despite never giving your phone number to a campaign, McDonald's asked for people to reach out to the number they gave out to receive news. I find this one distinct difference fascinating, as it feels like McDonald's is doing this so that they actively reach those that may care about the brand the most. If someone takes the first step and texts McDonald's first, then I feel like they're more likely to engage with the SMS campaign rather than just look at it once and then proceed to ignore it completely. If you saw a brand post a phone number, would you text it if you knew that it would lead to the brand sending targeted ads through text messages? Would you be more engaged with the marketing if you put in the effort of signing up for it yourself, or if it just came to you without any input?</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/mcdonald-s-steps-its-sms-marketing-efforts<br /></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,328,1605

<br />
I have accidentally signed up for some SMS marketing without knowing and I, personally, don't like it unless the brand is sending out promotional codes or letting me know about a sale, other than that I don't really enjoy getting updates on what's going on with the brand because it feels like unnecessary spam. I do, however, appreciate that most brands let the customer be aware of these marketing tactics, some have, unfortunately, used my number without my consent, which I don't care for. Even though I am not a big fan of receiving these messages, I do believe that SMS marketing is a great strategy for gaining consumers' attention. This is due to the sole fact that I check my texts much more than I check my emails. Therefore, I think that the future of SMS marketing is gearing up to be more personalized to the consumer, to offer more engagement between the brand and its consumers, and be a more seamless interaction in your everyday life!</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,170,792

One platform that we talk about quite a bit in class is Tiktok. In recent years, the big four platforms are Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. This article is including Microsoft as one of the big four as well. With the explosion and evident popularity of TikTok, these companies wanted to jump on advertising and spreading awareness about their products and who they are. As we mentioned in class, users don't buy products from brands, they buy the value they see in the brand and the product. Hanna Kalhart, an analyst at research and analysis company Midia Research, where she specializes in social media, cultural/consumer trends, and marketing/advertising, stated “Brands can’t just exist as brands anymore. They have to have an interface, something for audiences to actually engage with. Those big companies need to become more approachable and more personable because audiences are growing very used to being able to interact with the creators that they like.”</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">One thing this article also mentioned was the risks with data privacy and security. Google has been a victim of this news due to the announcement of removing cookies. In my ethics class, we talked about how big data and having ethical leaders are going to play a big role going forward with technological advances. The introduction of AI, having Tiktok know you better than you know yourself, and consumers' safety and privacy being respected are issues that citizens and specifically Generation Z may have to deal with the most. A big reason these large companies are going on TikTok is to reach the younger demographic. If you already have an audience present, and you know how the algorithm works, then reaching this new target market won't be a problem. Tiktok may or may not be a temporal platform in the future. With Facebook turning into the Meta Universe, anything is possible.</p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,352,1748

It is indeed a fact that we will be facing recession in the upcoming months. Martinez talks about the impact it could have on small businesses in terms of their digital marketing approaches. She stresses on the importance of marketing and content strategy being able to respond in a fast manner in terms of consumer demand. As mentioned previously, she provides six recommendations to up their game for the small businesses in the upcoming months. Firstly, she talks about the importance of the company being able to be discovered online. Secondly, she talks about prioritizing customer experience. Thirdly, she talks about staying connected with the audience. Fourthly, she talks about standardizing the brand voice. Fifthly, she talks about staying active on social media platforms. Lastly, she talks about the positive impact video marketing is having in the digital marketing world. </p><p dir=""ltr"">I would like to discuss how my insights from the article illustrate what we did in this course through the digital marketing campaign we did as team ""Tweets for Trice."" Our election candidate Patrice did have a significant presence digitally. She maintained her website which included all of the information about the election campaign. Any user would be able to get access to her information online to know more about her as a candidate. She did prioritize the needs of the audience by constantly being active on social media platforms such as Twitter by staying  connected with the audience. For instance, she posted regularly on her social media accounts and responded to any queries especially on Twitter. I felt like Patrice could have done a better job with standardizing the brand voice. I felt like more efforts were needed for credibility. Lastly, I agree that enough digital marketing methods were performed for the campaign. But as the article author mentioned, video marketing would be more effective as it shows that the candidate put in more effort to connect more to the audience. The videos would deliver the tone and attitude of the candidate to the audience to a great extent. Therefore, I would recommend video marketing in the future for any digital marketing purposes.

<p>This article highlights how the social media platforms
Facebook and Instagram were created to be as addictive as painkillers. The reason
behind the addictive design is for the companies to earn profit for the amount
of time a user spends on their digital platform. According to the article, on
average, Americans check their phones 262 times every day. Social media is
where most of this time is spent.  </p>

<p>A number of former employees of Apple, Google, and Facebook
have reported that these companies create applications that are intended to be
addictive. They emphasized the fact that these BIG Tech companies are more concerned
with profit than the mental health and well-being of their users. The addiction
potential is based on the reward stimulus provided from using these applications
which is very similar to the neural chemicals released when gambling or
partaking in drugs. The article focused on the differentiation of apps into two
categories painkiller and supplemental apps. Supplemental apps address specific
issues, simplify processes, and improve our quality of life. They typically
provide the information we need quickly, allowing us to use them sparingly and
briefly. Painkiller apps don't fulfill a specific need, we just find them
appealing. The key takeaway is that monetizing and being ethical are not mutually

As a company owns an industry monopoly, pricing becomes subjective and the company can increase prices however they wish, even to their own users. Simply stated, if this deal goes through, it is crucial to have measures in place to monitor Microsoft and Xbox so they don't outrageously increase the price of their game or subscriptions.

On November 11th, FTX filed for bankruptcy, shocking the world. Many analysts and experts believed that a cryptocurrency exchange with a history and market dominance like FTX was untouchable. To understand the situation, it is important to first understand who Sam Bankman-Fried is. He founded a hedge fund called Alameda Research in November 2017. Like many other hedge funds, he needed capital to back his venture. With an extensive understanding of cryptocurrency, he understood that cryptocurrency exchanges often held a native cryptocurrency token (Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency token). Thus, he founded FTX in 2019 and created FTT as its native token. Using FTT as a source of untraceable capital, he was able to fund Alameda Research and begin his career in both finance and crypto. </p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size:0.9375rem;"">On November 2nd, CoinDesk reported a leaked document showing that FTX was strongly tied to Alameda Research. CoinDesk detailed how Sam Bankman-Fried founded both companies and suspicious of the founder using capital from FTX to fund Alameda Research. This alone was reason enough for many investors to worry, as a crash in one company could result in a crash in the other. Many other cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance removed FTT as a token from their platform. This caused a crash in the token’s value and a panic by FTX users to withdraw over $6 billion in assets. Binance offered to bail FTX and pulled out of the deal in 24 hours causing even more panic for users and investors. FTX filed for bankruptcy and was shortly hacked where someone took over $400 million worth of tokens. Overall, there was a net operating loss of $3.7 billion.</span><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"">While a lengthy discussion can be had about the causes and effects of the FTX disaster, I would like to focus on the marketing repercussions that followed as a result. Cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges are new ideas that became popularized around 2020. This being said, most individuals have a hard time understanding what cryptocurrencies are and even less, a cryptocurrency exchange. FTX used this ambiguity to strike up partnerships with many notable sports franchises, stadiums, schools, and athletes. An example is NBA's Miami Heat.

It will be very interesting to see how this actually works out in the future and just how much of our world will be consumed by the metaverse. It is a shocking and concerning for reality for some, but many believe that this is the definition of our future as we know it. <br /><br />https://www.marketingdive.com/news/macys-metaverse-thanksgiving-day-parade-nft-balloon/637298/<br /><p></p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,239,1254

Hearing about this was shocking to me. I may be wrong for looking at it this way, but I’ve always seen the metaverse as a cartoon sims zoom meeting. It’s interesting to hear that they’re trying to implement a whole parade into a software that’s so new and not even popular yet. Thinking that bringing the parade into the metaverse with hardly any following right now seems absurd to me and waste of time and money for Macy’s.</div>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,80,361

I’ll go on Google and type in the brands that my parents and brother like and every brand has a paid advertisement at the top. However, the closer time has gotten to Black Friday, I’ve noticed the ads haven’t changed and the landing page you’re taken to doesn’t change. The only way I have seen a Black Friday ad is if I have typed in Black Friday after the brand name. Why would a company do this when if for the week the company could promote whatever sale they’re running for the day? I have found this particularly odd as I figured most brands would be trying to promote and gain as many impressions as possible leading up the big day. I would be interested to hear if anyone else had experienced this the last couple of weeks?</p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,157,676
